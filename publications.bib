  abstract = {Background Three genera of human papillomavirus (HPV) infect the oral cavity and oropharynx--- alpha ({$\alpha$}), beta ({$\beta$}) and gamma ({$\gamma$}). While {$\alpha$}-HPV infection is an established risk factor for head and neck cancers (HNC), the role of other genera remains unclear. We aimed to estimate the effect of {$\alpha$}-, {$\beta$}-, {$\gamma$}-HPV on HNC using a hospital-based case-control study. Methods We recruited incident HNC cases (396) and controls (439), frequency-matched by age and sex from four main referral hospitals in Montreal, Canada. We collected information on sociodemographic and behavior characteristics using in-person interviews, and tested rinse, brush and tumor specimens for HPV genotypes. We estimated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for the effect of HPV on HNC using logistic regression, adjusting for confounding. We conducted probabilistic bias analysis to account for potential exposure misclassification, selection bias, and residual confounding. Results {$\alpha$}-HPV genus had a strong effect on HNC, particularly HPV16 (aOR=22.6; 95\% CI: 10.8, 47.2). {$\beta$}-HPV was more common among controls (aOR=0.80; 95\% 0.57, 1.11). After adjustment for HPV16, we found weaker evidence for {$\gamma$}-HPV (aOR= 1.29; 95\% CI: 0.80, 2.08). Combined bias analyses for HPV16 increased the strength of the point estimate, but added imprecision (aOR=54.2, 95\%~CI: 10.7, 385.9). Conclusions {$\alpha$}-HPV, especially HPV16, appears to increase the risk for HNC, while there is little evidence for an effect of {$\beta$}- or {$\gamma$}-HPV. {$\beta$}-HPV may have a preventive effect, while {$\gamma$}-HPV may increase the risk of HNC, although to a lesser extent than that of {$\alpha$}-HPV. Results for cutaneous HPV were imprecise and less conclusive. Due to possible epidemiologic biases, the true relation between HPV and HNC could be underestimated in the literature. Further improvement in current methods and more studies of the biologic mechanisms of the three genera in HNC development are warranted.},

  abstract = {Background Beyond the prevention of illness and death, vaccination may provide additional benefits such as improved educational outcomes. However, there is currently little evidence on this question. Our objective was to estimate the effect of childhood vaccination on learning achievements among primary school children in India. Methods We used cohort data from the India Human Development Survey. Vaccination status and confounders were measured among children who were at least 12 months old at baseline in 2004--2005. In 2011--2012, the same children completed basic reading, writing and math tests. We estimated the effect of full vaccination during childhood on learning achievements using inverse probability of treatment-weighted logistic regression models and results reported on the risk difference scale. The propensity score included 33 potential community-, household-, mother- and child-level confounders as well as state fixed effects. Results Among the 4877 children included in our analysis, 54\% were fully vaccinated at baseline, and 54\% could read by the age of 8--11 years. The estimated effect of full vaccination on learning achievements ranged from 4 to 6 percentage points, representing relative increases ranging from 6\% to 12\%. Bias analysis suggested that our observed effects could be explained by unmeasured confounding, but only in the case of strong associations with the treatment and outcome. Conclusion These results support the hypothesis that vaccination has lasting effects on children's learning achievements. Further work is needed to confirm findings and elucidate the potential mechanisms linking vaccines to educational outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background Few studies have evaluated the relationship between preterm birth (PTB) and maternal education over time. We sought to determine whether educational inequalities in PTB have increased in Qu{\'e}bec, Canada. Methods The authors analysed 2 124 909 singleton live births from 1981 to 2006, and computed the Relative Index of Inequality (RII) and Slope Index of Inequality (SII) with 95\% CIs for the relationship between maternal education and extreme, very or moderate PTB ({$\leq$}27, 28--31, and 32--36 completed weeks of gestation, respectively) for five periods (1981--1985, 1986--1990, 1991--1995, 1996--2000, 2001--2006), adjusting for maternal age, marital status, birthplace, language spoken at home, parity and infant sex. Results Average rates of extreme and moderate PTB increased over time but decreased for very PTB. A statistically significant increase in the RII over time was present for extreme and moderate PTB. The adjusted RII for extreme PTB increased from 1.58 (95\% CI 1.24 to 2.01) in 1981--1985 to 3.11 (95\% CI 2.54 to 3.81) in 2001--2006. For moderate PTB, the corresponding RIIs were 1.53 (95\% CI 1.44 to 1.61) and 1.91 (95\% CI 1.81 to 2.01). Absolute differences in the PTB proportion between the least and most educated mothers increased from 1981 to 2006 for extreme (adjusted SII 0.11\% vs 0.28\%) and moderate PTB (adjusted SII 1.67\% vs 3.11\%). Absolute differences in the proportion very PTB did not increase. Conclusions Relative and absolute educational inequalities in extreme and moderate PTB have increased over time in Qu{\'e}bec. Relative increases were largest for extreme PTB, and absolute increases were largest for moderate PTB.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: For policy questions where substantial empirical background information exists, conventional frequentist policy analysis is hard to justify. Bayesian analysis quantitatively incorporates prior knowledge, but is not often used in applied policy analysis. METHODS: We combined 2000-2016 data from the Fatal Analysis Reporting System with priors based on past empirical studies and policy documents to study the impact of mandatory seat belt laws on traffic fatalities. We used a Bayesian data augmentation approach to combine information from prior studies with difference-in-differences analyses of recent law changes to provide updated evidence on the impact that upgrading to primary enforcement of seat belt laws has on fatalities. RESULTS: After incorporating the evidence from past studies, we find limited evidence to support the hypothesis that recent policy upgrades affect fatality rates. We estimate that upgrading to primary enforcement reduced fatality rates by 0.37 deaths per billion vehicle miles traveled (95\% posterior interval -0.90, 0.16), or a rate ratio of 0.96 (95\% posterior interval 0.91, 1.02), and increased the proportion of decedents reported as wearing seat belts by 7 percentage points (95\% posterior interval 5, 8), or a risk ratio of 1.18 (95\% posterior interval 1.13, 1.24). CONCLUSIONS: Bayesian methods can provide credible estimates of future policy impacts, especially for policy questions that occur in dynamic environments, such as traffic safety.},

The decline is small in absolute terms but is unprecedented and has generated considerable research interest and theorizing about potential causes. Recent trends show that the decline has affected nearly all race/ethnic and gender groups, and the proximate causes of the decline are increases in opioid overdose deaths, suicide, homicide, and Alzheimer's disease. A slowdown in the long-term decline in mortality from cardiovascular diseases has also prevented life expectancy from improving further. Although a popular explanation for the decline is the cumulative decline in living standards across generations, recent trends suggest that distinct mechanisms for specific causes of death are more plausible explanations. Interventions to stem the increase in overdose deaths, reduce access to mechanisms that contribute to violent deaths, and decrease cardiovascular risk over the life course are urgently needed to improve mortality in the United States.},
