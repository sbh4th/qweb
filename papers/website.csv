We sought to determine whether educational inequalities in PTB have increased in Québec, Canada. Methods The authors analysed 2 124 909 singleton live births from 1981 to 2006, and computed the Relative Index of Inequality (RII) and Slope Index of Inequality (SII) with 95% CIs for the relationship between maternal education and extreme, very or moderate PTB (≤27, 28–31, and 32–36 completed weeks of gestation, respectively) for five periods (1981–1985, 1986–1990, 1991–1995, 1996–2000, 2001–2006), adjusting for maternal age, marital status, birthplace, language spoken at home, parity and infant sex. Results Average rates of extreme and moderate PTB increased over time but decreased for very PTB. A statistically significant increase in the RII over time was present for extreme and moderate PTB. The adjusted RII for extreme PTB increased from 1.58 (95% CI 1.24 to 2.01) in 1981–1985 to 3.11 (95% CI 2.54 to 3.81) in 2001–2006. For moderate PTB, the corresponding RIIs were 1.53 (95% CI 1.44 to 1.61) and 1.91 (95% CI 1.81 to 2.01). Absolute differences in the PTB proportion between the least and most educated mothers increased from 1981 to 2006 for extreme (adjusted SII 0.11% vs 0.28%) and moderate PTB (adjusted SII 1.67% vs 3.11%). Absolute differences in the proportion very PTB did not increase. Conclusions Relative and absolute educational inequalities in extreme and moderate PTB have increased over time in Québec. Relative increases were largest for extreme PTB, and absolute increases were largest for moderate PTB.","2011-12-01","2019-10-03 21:02:03","2019-10-03 21:02:03","2019-10-03 21:02:03","1091-1096","","12","65","","J Epidemiol Community Health","","","","","","","","en","© 2011, Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Bayesian analysis quantitatively incorporates prior knowledge, but is not often used in applied policy analysis. METHODS: We combined 2000-2016 data from the Fatal Analysis Reporting System with priors based on past empirical studies and policy documents to study the impact of mandatory seat belt laws on traffic fatalities. We used a Bayesian data augmentation approach to combine information from prior studies with difference-in-differences analyses of recent law changes to provide updated evidence on the impact that upgrading to primary enforcement of seat belt laws has on fatalities. RESULTS: After incorporating the evidence from past studies, we find limited evidence to support the hypothesis that recent policy upgrades affect fatality rates. We estimate that upgrading to primary enforcement reduced fatality rates by 0.37 deaths per billion vehicle miles traveled (95% posterior interval -0.90, 0.16), or a rate ratio of 0.96 (95% posterior interval 0.91, 1.02), and increased the proportion of decedents reported as wearing seat belts by 7 percentage points (95% posterior interval 5, 8), or a risk ratio of 1.18 (95% posterior interval 1.13, 1.24). CONCLUSIONS: Bayesian methods can provide credible estimates of future policy impacts, especially for policy questions that occur in dynamic environments, such as traffic safety.","2019-05","2020-11-01 19:22:48","2024-10-23 19:05:10","","380-387","","3","30","","Epidemiology","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","PMID: 30964813 tex.date-added: 2019-05-15 11:29:14 -0400 tex.date-modified: 2019-05-15 11:29:14 -0400 tex.howpublished: ppublish Citation Key: harper2019ph","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While α-HPV infection is an established risk factor for head and neck cancers (HNC), the role of other genera remains unclear. We aimed to estimate the effect of α-, β-, γ-HPV on HNC using a hospital-based case-control study. Methods We recruited incident HNC cases (396) and controls (439), frequency-matched by age and sex from four main referral hospitals in Montreal, Canada. We collected information on sociodemographic and behavior characteristics using in-person interviews, and tested rinse, brush and tumor specimens for HPV genotypes. We estimated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the effect of HPV on HNC using logistic regression, adjusting for confounding. We conducted probabilistic bias analysis to account for potential exposure misclassification, selection bias, and residual confounding. Results α-HPV genus had a strong effect on HNC, particularly HPV16 (aOR=22.6; 95% CI: 10.8, 47.2). β-HPV was more common among controls (aOR=0.80; 95% 0.57, 1.11). After adjustment for HPV16, we found weaker evidence for γ-HPV (aOR= 1.29; 95% CI: 0.80, 2.08). Combined bias analyses for HPV16 increased the strength of the point estimate, but added imprecision (aOR=54.2, 95% CI: 10.7, 385.9). Conclusions α-HPV, especially HPV16, appears to increase the risk for HNC, while there is little evidence for an effect of β- or γ-HPV. β-HPV may have a preventive effect, while γ-HPV may increase the risk of HNC, although to a lesser extent than that of α-HPV. Results for cutaneous HPV were imprecise and less conclusive. Due to possible epidemiologic biases, the true relation between HPV and HNC could be underestimated in the literature. Further improvement in current methods and more studies of the biologic mechanisms of the three genera in HNC development are warranted.","2022-08-01","2022-07-01 14:23:27","2022-07-01 14:23:29","2022-07-01 14:23:27","102205","","","79","","Cancer Epidemiology","Do cutaneous human papillomavirus genotypes affect head and neck cancer?","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Alphapapillomavirus; Betapapillomavirus; Epidemiologic Biases; Gammapapillomavirus; Head and Neck Neoplasms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is currently little evidence on this question. Our objective was to estimate the effect of childhood vaccination on learning achievements among primary school children in India. Methods We used cohort data from the India Human Development Survey. Vaccination status and confounders were measured among children who were at least 12 months old at baseline in 2004–2005. In 2011–2012, the same children completed basic reading, writing and math tests. We estimated the effect of full vaccination during childhood on learning achievements using inverse probability of treatment-weighted logistic regression models and results reported on the risk difference scale. The propensity score included 33 potential community-, household-, mother- and child-level confounders as well as state fixed effects. Results Among the 4877 children included in our analysis, 54% were fully vaccinated at baseline, and 54% could read by the age of 8–11 years. The estimated effect of full vaccination on learning achievements ranged from 4 to 6 percentage points, representing relative increases ranging from 6% to 12%. Bias analysis suggested that our observed effects could be explained by unmeasured confounding, but only in the case of strong associations with the treatment and outcome. Conclusion These results support the hypothesis that vaccination has lasting effects on children’s learning achievements. Further work is needed to confirm findings and elucidate the potential mechanisms linking vaccines to educational outcomes.","2020-10-01","2022-10-13 20:04:31","2022-10-13 20:04:40","2022-10-13 20:04:31","778-784","","10","74","","J Epidemiol Community Health","Effect of vaccination on children’s learning achievements","","","","","","","en","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Components included training healthcare providers and community health workers, infrastructure upgrades, and improvements to health management. This study aimed to examine the impact of trainings on four key outcomes: skilled birth attendance, antenatal care, respectful maternity care and patient–provider communication. Methods Trainings were delivered sequentially at four time points between 2018 and 2019 in eight districts (two districts at a time). Cross-sectional surveys were administered to a random sample of households in all districts at baseline and after each training wave. Due to practical necessities, the original stepped wedge cluster randomised design of the evaluation was altered mid-programme. Therefore, a difference-in-differences for multiple groups in multiple periods was adopted to compare outcomes in treated districts to not yet treated districts. Risk differences were estimated for the overall average treatment effect on the treated and group/time dynamic effects. Results Respondents reported 3895 deliveries over the course of the study. The intervention was associated with a 12.9 percentage point increase in skilled birth attendance (95% CI 0.4 to 25.4), which began to increase 4 months after the end of training in each district. There was little evidence of impact on antenatal care visits, respectful treatment during delivery and patient–provider communication. Conclusion Interventions to train local healthcare workers in basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care increased skilled birth attendance but had limited impact on other pregnancy-related outcomes.","2023-04-28","2023-05-04 14:18:07","2023-05-04 14:18:19","2023-05-04 14:18:07","","","","","","J Epidemiol Community Health","","","","","","","","en","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

The strongest evidence for direct health effects is among states in the United States, but even that is somewhat mixed.

The decline is small in absolute terms but is unprecedented and has generated considerable research interest and theorizing about potential causes. Recent trends show that the decline has affected nearly all race/ethnic and gender groups, and the proximate causes of the decline are increases in opioid overdose deaths, suicide, homicide, and Alzheimer's disease. A slowdown in the long-term decline in mortality from cardiovascular diseases has also prevented life expectancy from improving further. Although a popular explanation for the decline is the cumulative decline in living standards across generations, recent trends suggest that distinct mechanisms for specific causes of death are more plausible explanations. Interventions to stem the increase in overdose deaths, reduce access to mechanisms that contribute to violent deaths, and decrease cardiovascular risk over the life course are urgently needed to improve mortality in the United States.","2021","2023-06-19 15:32:23","2023-06-19 15:32:23","2023-06-19 15:32:22","381-403","","1","42","","","Declining Life Expectancy in the United States","","","","","","","","","","","","Annual Reviews","","_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-082619-104231 PMID: 33326297","","/Users/samharper/Dropbox/work/research/zotero/Harper-2021-Declining_Life.pdf; /Users/samharper/Dropbox/work/research/zotero/Harper-2021-Declining_Life3.pdf","","","cardiovascular diseases; health inequalities; homicide; life expectancy; opioids; suicide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Study design: National registry-based quasi-experimental study. Methods: We obtained data from the Dutch Perinatal Registry (2010-2020) which was linked to multiple population registries containing sociodemographic variables. A difference-in-discontinuity approach was used to examine the impact of COVID-19 mitigation measures on various perinatal outcomes. We investigated preterm birth incidence across onset types, alongside other perinatal outcomes including low birth weight, small-for-gestational-age, NICU admission, low-APGAR-score, perinatal mortality, neonatal death, and stillbirths. Results: The analysis of the national-level dataset revealed a consistent pattern of reduced preterm births after the enactment of COVID-19 mitigation measures on March 9, 2020 (OR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.68-0.96). A drop in spontaneous preterm births post-implementation was observed (OR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.62-0.98), whereas no change was observed for iatrogenic births. Regarding stillbirths (OR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.46-1.95) our analysis did not find compelling evidence of substantial changes. For the remaining outcomes, no discernible shifts were observed. Conclusions: Our findings confirm the reduction in preterm births following COVID-19 mitigation measures in the Netherlands. No discernible changes were observed for other outcomes, including stillbirths.
