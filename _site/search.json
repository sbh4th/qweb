    "text": "Teaching at McGill\nPresently I teach two courses at McGill: a new PhD-level seminar focused on current substantive and methodological issues in epidemiology, and a course on Impact Evaluation, which I have been co-teaching with Arijit Nandi since 2016.\n\nEPIB 706\nEPIB 706 is a PhD-level seminar aimed at providing space for students to engage with overarching concepts critical to the theory and practice of epidemiology, as well to explore recent controversies and debates in the field. This course is designed to reinforce formal coursework through making space to develop and sharpen critical thinking skills. We review a selection of papers that range across methods, principles, arguments, and debates in epidemiology and the wider scientific community.\nRecent versions of this course:\n\nWinter 2023\nFall 2020\n\n\n\nPPHS 617\nThis course covers methods for estimating the effects of social interventions on health outcomes. We introduce and provide the intuition for conducting impact evaluation studies in public and population health and discuss recent methodological developments. We define causal policy effects within the potential outcomes framework and contrast methods for describing associations between an intervention and health outcome with methods for estimating causal effects. We introduce and formally define policy-relevant research questions based on specific causal contrasts. The course format is a mixture of didactic lectures, classroom evaluations of published evaluations, homework assignments, and student presentations. We introduce students to approaches for estimating the effects of social interventions, classified broadly as experimental or observational (quasi-experimental). The section on experimental research covers the use of randomized trials and cluster randomized trials for impact evaluation. The section on observational designs will describe quasi-experimental techniques, including interrupted time series, difference-in-differences, instrumental variables, synthetic control, and regression discontinuity designs."

Perusall is a reading platform in which students (and faculty) annotate texts collaboratively alongside one another. More information on how Perusall works and how it is integrated into the course is available here (thank you Arizona State!). To access Perusall through MyCourses, navigate to Content > Readings > Perusall, and then click the “Open Link” button. This will take you to the Perusall site and automatically register you as a member of the course. If you are having any trouble accessing the readings through Perusall contact me right away. I will not be using Perusall’s grading features, but I expect you to read, post questions, respond to other students questions and answers, and to take an active role in generating productive discussion."

Toward that end, over the course of the semester you will be asked to submit one original, critical essay that explores a topic of relevance to epidemiologic science. It may be a direct response to material that we read or discuss in class, or it may be an essay exploring other topics relevant to your work that demonstrate a good-faith effort to engage with the class material. These should take the form of a commentary similar (in spirit) to those we have read during the semester, and should be no longer than 2500 words. An outline of the essay, including the basic arguments you want to make, is due on March 10, 2023 and the final essay is due on April 19, 2023. I will provide examples of what I think are good pieces of writing to aspire to."

For that session, you will come prepared to briefly summarize the material we have read, and to prepare some discussion points to help keep the conversation moving. I have created a Google spreadsheet with the current days for each topic here. Please sign-up for a session and we can have a discussion about the readings and where to draw on other resources for the topic. Note: We have 25 sessions and 14 students this year, so not everyone is required to lead 2 sessions. You should be able to sort this out, but if the remaining slots don’t get filled I will happily assign them.\nAlthough each class session is 1.5 hours, there will inevitably be topics that come up that we can’t fully address in class. I encourage you to use the Discussion section of MyCourses to post questions or comments there. In past years I have also used this as a place to occassionally post links to additional readings for those interested.\n\n\nParticipation\nReal engagement means active participation. This can take many forms, but for some general guidance, this means:\n\nShowing up for each class having read and engaged with the material assigned. It will help facilitate discussion if you could aim to contribute at least 2-3 points for discussion or questions about the material in Perusall, and bring those to class;\nFocusing during class discussion and avoiding distractions, and being present and intellectually engaged during the discussion;\nAsking questions about anything in the readings that seems unclear or objectionable (in class, outside class, online). This can include both specific ideas from the readings, as well as synthesizing or finding themes common to different readings or our discussion;\nOffering respectful arguments and responses, and respectfully listening to the arguments and responses of others. Contributions should be relevant and helpful and demonstrate that you are engaging with the material being discussed at the time, and that you are well-prepared for class."

    "text": "6.1 Week 1: What is the present and future of epidemiology as a discipline?\nWhy are we doing this?\nBecause this is not a didactic course that is focused on learning methods or technical skills, and because in the past this course has often been critiqued for not providing a solid rationale for why it even exists, I owe it to you to provide some justification for the topics and readings I’ve chosen, as well as for why I think this material would be useful for your doctoral training. For each set of assigned material (the ‘What’), I’ve included a brief rationale (the ‘Why’). I hope you find it helpful.\n\nWednesday 2023-01-04: Course introduction\n\nAdministrative aspects of the course.\nRound table – introductions.\nDiscussion of objectives and competencies.\n\nIn the first session we will talk generally about high-level questions regarding the discipline of epidemiology as a whole. Although you are early on in your training, I think it is valuable for you to be aware of these broader discussions about where the field stands in relation to its past, and what the appropriate balance should be between descriptive, causal, or implementation questions. Having some knowledge about the intellectual history of different concepts (“risk factor epidemiology”, “consequential epidemiology”) will help you to figure out where your own work stands in relation to the discipline as a whole.\n\n\nFriday 2023-01-06: Reflections on epidemiology’s past and present\n\nWhat:\n\nDavey Smith G. Post–Modern Epidemiology: When Methods Meet Matter. Am J Epidemiol 2019;188(8):1410–1419. [link] [8601 words]\nLesko CR, Keil AP, Edwards JK. The Epidemiologic Toolbox: Identifying, Honing, and Using the Right Tools for the Job. Am J Epidemiol 2020;189(6):511–517. [link] [3675 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThe Davey Smith paper provides a bit of historical orientation to the ‘modern’ epidemiology training you are getting, as well as a critique of it in relation to epidemiology’s past. I chose the Lesko et al. paper because it focuses on the relationship between the tools of epidemiology (about which you are learning a lot in this first year) and the kinds of questions that can be answered with those tools. In particular, they focus on differences between purely descriptive questions, questions about synthesized evidence on causal relationships, and questions about specific interventions for which we want to estimate a causal effect. I also like that it was written by early career researchers whose training is in many ways similar to your own."

Is ‘novelty’ more important than making incremental progress? Should it matter whether a given question will produce ‘actionable’ evidence? And is it problematic if a study’s methods are not well aligned with the question it seeks to answer? Is it wasteful (or, even unethical) to produce such work?\n\nWednesday 2023-01-11: Does it matter whether questions and methods align?\n\nWhat:\n\nFox MP, Murray EJ, Lesko CR, Sealy-Jefferson S.

[link] [5650 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nWhat is the relationship between research questions and methods? Should we just use multivariable regression for everything? Does it actually matter? Fox et al. argue for the importance and need to reinvigorate descriptive epidemiology, and make a case that this has particular consequences for both theory and methods. The paper by Hernan and colleagues tries to lay out how questions and methods should be aligned in empirical data science research. This paper was written when enthusiasm for machine learning and other empirical data science algorithms began achieving a high degree of influence, and their paper aims to try and clarify the utility of being clear about the question being asked, the methods used to answer it, and the role of expert knowledge in generating the result.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-01-13: What makes a ‘good’ question?\n\nWhat:\n\nBanack H.

How will you decide what questions to answer with your work, and how will you evaluate the questions others are asking?"

    "section": "6.3 Week 3: How important is formal causal inference?",
    "text": "6.3 Week 3: How important is formal causal inference?\nMuch of modern epidemiologic training now starts with the introduction of potential outcomes framework, as well as introducing DAGs as a way to draw and consider assumptions needed for doing causal inference. What are the implications of using these frameworks for the kinds of questions that can be asked and answered in epidemiology? Do we risk restricting ourselves to ‘formal’ methods when it comes to causal questions, or are other alternatives possible? These are fundamental questions about the nature of epidemiologic inquiry, and it is useful for you to consider the benefits and drawbacks that may come with adopting this epistemological stance. As you progress in your training, you’ll need to decide on how you will approach questions of causal inference both in your own work and in your evaluations of the wider epidemiologic literature.\n\nWednesday 2023-01-18: Are potential outcomes and DAGs necessary?\n\nWhat:\n\nKrieger N, Davey Smith G. The tale wagged by the DAG: broadening the scope of causal inference and explanation for epidemiology. Int J Epidemiol. 2016 12;45(6):1787–1808.

Int J Epidemiol. 2016 12;45(6):1817–1829. [link] [10561 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThe first set of papers for this session come from an older, but still relevant “debate” about the utility and consequences of the “formal” approach to causal inference in epidemiology, which you likely now take for granted, since that is what most ‘modern’ epi programs teach (including ours). Krieger/Davey Smith are asking critical questions of potential outcomes and DAGs (the latter was also the editor at IJE at the time, hence the ‘relaxed’ approach to word limits), and Daniel et al. defending, more or less the modern approach. Look forward to hearing your thoughts.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-01-20: Are well-defined interventions needed for causal questions?\n\nWhat:\n\nSchwartz S, Gatto NM, Campbell UB. Causal identification: a charge of epidemiology in danger of marginalization. Ann Epidemiol 2016;26(10):669-673. [link]. [4069 words]\nHernan MA. Does water kill?

Heeding the call for less casual causal inferences: the utility of realized (quantitative) causal effects. Ann Epidemiol 2017;27(6):402-405. [link]. [2756 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThe second set of readings for this week is meant to engage with a more specific critique of ‘modern’ causal inference methods, namely, the notion that ‘good’ causal questions are based on well-defined interventions. This is a more recent argument, largely associated with Miguel Hernan and linked to the idea of using ‘target trials’ to formulate questions for observational studies.\nAs academics are wont to do, there has been some pushback against this idea, notably by Sharon Schwartz, another long-term and thoughtful critic of epidemiology (see her nice 1999 pre-causal-inference-revolution paper in Am J Public Health on the consequences of what she called, ‘Type III error’ which is about asking the wrong question). She and other critics are pushing back against this idea and trying to understand it’s implications (again) for the kinds of causal questions we can answer (and note that I think this is a different sort of critique than was being made by Krieger/Davey Smith)."

This set of readings aims to try and clarify some of these conceptual questions and derive potential paths forward that respect the “rules” of causal inference but that can also provide evidence that may be useful for reducing differences in health across non-manipulable factors.\n\nWednesday 2023-01-25: Are non-manipulable exposures causes?\n\nWhat:\n\nVanderWeele TJ, Robinson WR.

[link] [2378 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThe paper by Vanderweele and Robinson tries to address the issue of non-manipulable exposures (specifically race) in a way that respects the complexity of this kind of exposure, but attempts to move forward to see whether it is helpful to reframe the question to how interventions on factors plausibly affected by race may affect racial differences in health. Meanwhile, Glymour and Spiegelman offer more of a defense of the idea that non-manipulable factors are causes and deserve the same kind of consideration and treatment as other exposures we study routinely in epidemiology. Finally, the blog post by Boyd is a relatively new piece making strong arguments for how race should be reported and interpreted in epidemiologic and clinical studies.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-01-27: Case study: race in clinical treatment.\n\nWhat:\n\nVyas DA, Eisenstein LG, Jones DS. Hidden in Plain Sight — Reconsidering the Use of Race Correction in Clinical Algorithms. New Engl J Med 2020;383(9):874–82. [link] [6251 words]\nManski CF. Patient-centered appraisal of race-free clinical risk assessment. Health Econ 2022;31(10):2109–14. [link] [4133 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nTaking a bit of a break from conceptual readings on questions and causal inference, in the second session we delve into a case study of the challenges in the use of race in clinical medicine. Should we use race as a factor in recommending treatments to patients? Does it matter whether or not race is a cause of the outcome, or whether including race might affect inequalities? The two papers from Vyas et al. and Manski arrive at different arguments regarding whether or not race should be included, and I think they provide a rich set of issues to discuss that complement the arguments about how we should study non-manipulable exposures in epidemiology."

You want to study intervention \\(X\\), which is not known to be either harmful or beneficial, can be ethically and feasibly delivered, and has plausible reasons why it should affect \\(Y\\).

Understanding and misunderstanding randomized controlled trials. Soc Sci Med 2018;210:2–21. [link] [22882 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nDeaton and Cartwright’s paper provides an overview of core philosophical, conceptual, and statistical concepts of randomized trials, and a lot of comments on their benefits and drawbacks. Haushofer and Metcalf apply questions about the feasibility to our pandemic circumstances (though it seems a long time ago that they published this in May of 2020, before viable vaccines, before new strains, before second, third, omicron waves). As epidemiologists, I think you will benefit from getting into the weeds a bit about randomized designs and grappling with questions about when and where they might be appropriate.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-02-03: What if we can’t randomize?\n\nWhat:\n\nLodi S, Phillips A, Lundgren J, Logan R, Sharma S, Cole SR, et al. Effect Estimates in Randomized Trials and Observational Studies: Comparing Apples With Apples. Am J Epidemiol 2019 08;188(8):1569–1577. [link] [3044 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nDespite some important strengths of randomized designs, especially for exchangeability, in some cases it just won’t be feasible or ethical to pursue a randomized design. What then? Anything goes? Just plug all the confounders into your regression and hope for the best? There are still good reasons to consider thinking conceptually about the trial you would design if feasibility and ethical issues were irrelevant, and then attempting to pursue an observational design that corresponds as closely as possible to your hypothetical “target trial”.\nLodi et al. are really focused on comparing results from an observational study to a trial that both investigate the same question, and their paper shows a practical example of how you might think about approaching this question (I would say even if you don’t have trial data). Nevertheless, this design still focuses almost entirely on regression adjustment as a way of achieving exchangeability–a rather strong assumption, and one that may be difficult to sell to critics."

[link] [6921 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nDebates about whether studies designed to estimate causal effects need to be representative, or alternatively should purposefully be designed not to be representative, have been persistent in epidemiology, but have also become more pressing given increasing concerns for generalizability. This paper by Rothman arguing that causal studies should avoid representative samples created a bit of a stir a few years ago, and has produced some additional empirical work on how much this matters. These issues are important for when you are both producing and consuming research, and it will be worthwhile to struggle a bit with them.

This is a core issue of moving from sampled data and analysis to the kind of inferences you will make about causal effects. How will you approach it?\n\nThursday Wednesday 2023-02-15: How should we use p-values?\n\nWhat:\n\nWasserstein RL, Schirm AL, Lazar NA. Moving to a world beyond “p<0.05”. The American Statistician 2019;73(sup1):1–19. [link]. [10923 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nWasserstein et al. provide a series of arguments for abandoning p-value thresholds, some of which you are likely to have heard before, but there is much more in this paper. They make a number of positive arguments for how we should be conducting inference, and interpreting the results of research, and they aim to try and provide solid foundations for being more thoughtful about how to interpret evidence.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-02-17: What are alternatives to p-values?\n\nWhat:\n\nGreenland S, Mansournia MA, Joffe M. To curb research misreporting, replace significance and confidence by compatibility. Prev Med 2022;164:107127. [link] [4493 words]\nHarhay MO, Blette BS, Granholm A, Moler FW, Zampieri FG, Goligher EC, et al. A Bayesian Interpretation of a Pediatric Cardiac Arrest Trial (THAPCA-OH). NEJM Evidence. 2022;2(1):EVIDoa2200196. [link] [7203 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nGiven the Wasserstein paper’s suggestion to abandon statistical significance, questions naturally arise about how we should do inference instead of using p-values. Most epidemiologists are trained to use confidence intervals rather than p-values, but it does not appear to have changed the basic problem of scientists dichotomizing evidence using arbitrary statistical rules. These papers attempt to provide some alternative avenues to explore. Greenland et al. continue their quest to promote notions of ‘compatibility’ rather than significance. I included the Harhay et al. paper because it shows how to provide a more nuanced interpretation of a ‘non-significant’ RCT using straightforward Bayesian inference. This should get you thinking about how you will manage your inferences in your own research"

    "text": "6.8 Week 8: How bad can it be?\nThis week’s readings move beyond inference on the main quantitative question or hypothesis of interest and are focused on concepts and methods relevant to testing and probing the assumptions needed to interpret quantitative evidence. These ideas are crucial for thinking about testing alternative explanations for observed findings, and quantifying the assumptions needed to do so.\n\nWednesday 2023-02-22: How can we quantify our assumptions?\n\nWhat:\n\nLash TL, Fox MP, MacLehose RF, Maldonado G, McCandless LC, Greenland S. Good practices for quantitative bias analysis. Int J Epidemiol 2014;43(6):1969–85. [link] [12518 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nLash et al. provide a long overview of good practices for such bias analysis, discussing both the motivation for why one would want to to conduct bias analysis and the mechanics of how to do so (choosing parameters, considering uncertainty). These methods are valuable for most study designs, but may be especially so for “garden variety” observational studies that must rely on basic regression adjustment to have any hope of making causal inferences.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-02-24: Can bias analysis be biased?\n\nWhat:\n\nLash TL, Ahern TP, Collin LJ, Fox MP, MacLehose RF. Bias Analysis Gone Bad. Am J Epidemiol 2021;190(8):1604–12. [link] [6451 words]\nGustafson P. To Bound or Not to Bound: Is That the Question? Epid 2021;32(5):635–7. [link] [2191 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nAlthough sensitivity analysis has been around a long time, quantitative bias analysis continues to be rare, and perhaps one explanation is that it asks a lot from researchers. Other options may include using simple bounds to answer questions about how bad things would have to be to ‘nullify’ an effect, but replacing ignoring assumptions with absurd assumptions leaves much to be desired. Lash et al. demonstrate how to do bias analysis ‘better’ and what can go wrong when it is not done with care. Gustafson, in a comment on some other papers, provides an interesting hypothetical set of scenarios for different ways of combining different study designs and strategies for accounting for bias. I hope you can come away with an appreciation and understanding of why such analyses are valuable."

    "text": "6.10 Week 10: To whom do epidemiologic results apply?\nWe have spent time now thinking about developing questions, considering whether to randomize treatments, making statistical inferences about population or causal parameters, and thinking about how to address biases. This week, we are moving on to thinking about the question of to whom our study results should apply. These are core questions that come up in the context of evaluating strengths and weaknesses of studies in peer review (or perhaps grant review), and whether the results of studies may provide actionable evidence.\n\nWednesday 2023-03-08: How should we think about generalizing to other populations?\n\nWhat:\n\nLesko CR, Buchanan AL, Westreich D, Edwards JK, Hudgens MG, Cole SR. Generalizing Study Results: A Potential Outcomes Perspective. Epidemiology 2017;28:553–561. [link] [6631 words]\nWestreich D, Edwards JK, Lesko CR, Cole SR, Stuart EA. Target Validity and the Hierarchy of Study Designs. Am J Epidemiol 2019;188:438–443. [link] [5308 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nDespite the clear importance of considering to whom study results should apply, there has been little formal work on what assumptions are needed to derive quantitative estimates of effects in different external populations, whether those refer to the target population or a population that is external to the target. These two papers argue that we should consider these formal approaches, and provide some guidance as to what assumptions (and potentially data) would be needed to do so.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-03-10: Should we generalize to specific individuals?\n\nWhat:\n\nKhoury, MJ et al. The Intersection of Genomics and Big Data with Public Health: Opportunities for Precision Public Health.

[link] [6793 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThe second part of our readings on extending results to other populations reframes the question not about transporting results to a different sample, but about how to (and whether we can) derive reliable predictions about treatment effects at the individual level. This is related to ongoing discussions about the concepts of “precision” epidemiology or precision public health, and whether these ideas are really novel or just ways of re-branding what we have always considered in public health, which is targeting when it comes to interventions. There have emerged different ‘camps’ of those more and less enthusiastic about this idea, and these two papers are meant to provide an overview of some of these issues."

    "text": "6.11 Week 11: Is research (including epidemiology) reliable?\nThis week we are stepping away a bit from epidemiology only, and focusing on larger questions related potential problems that may be widespread across scientific research (obviously, including epidemiology). Can or should we trust most published research? Is it reliable? Is it replicable and, if not, is that really a problem? Many of these issues have come up in the context of something that has been called the “replication crisis” in science, much of which started when some high-profile lab and social science projects were found not to replicate using similar designs and methods.\n\nWednesday 2023-03-15: Is science broken?\n\nWhat:\n\nOliver, J.

Nature 2021;593:182-5 [link] [3884 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThe video by Oliver discusses wild claims, the propensity of such claims to be blown up by the media, as well as problems with incentives. Additional evidence on these issues comes from a survey of scientists reported in Nature across a broad number of fields, as well as a report by Pearson on how this has played out in research on the pandemic.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-03-17: What are some potential solutions?\n\nWhat:\n\nMunafo MR et al. A manifesto for reproducible science. Nature Human Behaviour 2017;1:1–9.

Most of you will have heard (and I agree) that it a single study is unlikely to be sufficient to generate certainty about a given exposure-outcome effect. There may be special circumstances (e.g, vaccine trials for COVID-19), but generally we are starting from a place where we have to consider various lines of argument and evidence to inform our thinking.\n\nWednesday 2023-03-22: Can “triangulation” help?\n\nWhat:\n\nLawlor DA, Tilling K, Davey Smith G. Triangulation in aetiological epidemiology. Int J Epidemiol 2016;45(6):1866–86. [link] [14610 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nYou may have seen various papers talk about the concept of ‘triangulation’ in thinking about evidence. The Lawlor et al. paper focuses on trying to pull together (sometimes by design) data sources that may trade off different kinds of biases in order to see whether results are consistent across various settings, but in a formal and methodological way. I encourage you to consider whether you think it is a useful approach.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-03-24: Does meta-analysis help or hurt?\n\nWhat:\n\nHilton Boon M, Burns J, Craig P, Griebler U, Heise TL, Vittal Katikireddi S, et al. Value and Challenges of Using Observational Studies in Systematic Reviews of Public Health Interventions.

Occup Environ Med 2021;78(9):621–2. [link] [2029 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nMeta-analysis of a systematic review has become the dominant method for summarizing epidemiologic evidence, but comes with a large set of challenges, particularly for observational studies. These two papers provide an overview of some of the challenges of how these contribute to evidence, and whether they are ultimately useful for informing causal inference about the effects of exposures."

The readings are from two seasoned epidemiologists and provide some overarching guidance thinking about how far to ‘push’ with your results, and what the benefits and drawbacks of different levels of engagement with the broader scientific community might be.\n\nWednesday 2023-03-29: How should we discuss epidemiologic results?\n\nWhat:\n\nSavitz DA, Wellenius GA. Characterization and Communication of Conclusions. In: Interpreting epidemiologic evidence: connecting research to applications. Oxford University Press; 2016. p. 200–10. [link] [5958 words]\nBlastland M et al. Five rules for evidence communication. Nature 2020;587:362–364 [link] [2664 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThe second session’s readings are focused more on how to grapple with and communicate uncertainty in epidemiologic findings, both to other scientists (e.g., in peer-reviewed papers) and to the public or to other stakeholders. The chapter by Savitz and Wellenius provides some high-level guidance and advice to epidemiologists about their duties to describe evidence in a dispassionate way, but also to make good faith efforts to distill findings in ways suitably tailored for different audiences. Some additional discussion of how to consider biases across different studies when synthesizing evidence is also included. The piece by Blastland et al. is more direct in providing advice to scientists on how to communicate about evidence, largely arguing that our duties are to be transparent in reporting, especially about uncertainty, rather than attempting to persuade or change opinions.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-03-31: How much does “evidence” even matter?\n\nWhat:\n\nGreenhalgh T. Miasmas, Mental Models and Preventive Public Health: Some Philosophical Reflections on Science in the COVID-19 Pandemic. Interface Focus 2021;11: 1-8. [link] [7602 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nGreenhalgh uses the twin examples of the 19th century cholera epidemics in England and the present pandemic to talk about the role of ‘extra-scientific’ values in shaping how we view and decide on what kind of ‘evidence’ is compelling, and ties this to current (and ongoing) debates regarding the use of evidence in the COVID-19 pandemic."

This creates a kind of cultural inertia in science that has produced important advances, but also creates problems. Can we change the culture to improve the way epidemiology is working today?

Mathur and Fox make a strong case for greater openness and transparency, specifically in epidemiology. Lakens (a psychologist) makes a case that ethical review boards have an obligation to consider whether proposed research is capable of producing reliable evidence, and suggests they should have the power to intervene to stop work that has a low probability of providing reliable evidence.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-04-07: No class (Good Friday)"
