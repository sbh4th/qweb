My work is interdisciplinary, combining epidemiological methods with social science approaches to gain insights into the complex interactions between health and society. My research covers a wide variety of topics, but my major areas of focus are:\n\n\nMethods for measuring health inequalities. Measuring and monitoring health inequalities are crucial activites for providing evidence on the impact of medical interventions and policies on vulnerable populations, and for testing the plausibility of etiologic factors that may influence social differences in health. My work takes a systematic approach to health inequality measurement and emphasizes the importance that extra-scientific value judgments play in interpreting evidence on the magnitude and trends of health inequalities.\n\n\nAnalysis of life expectancy trends. Life expectancy is a fundamental and well-established measure of overall population health. I have made extensive use of demographic techniques for decomposing changes in life expectancy between social groups as a tool for generating evidence on the causes of health inequalities.\n\n\nExperimental and quasi-experimental approaches to health inequalities. I use randomized interventions and plausibly random changes in social and economic policies to estimate the causal effects of exposures on population health and health inequalities. I have used econometric techniques such as difference-in-differences and instrumental variables to estimate the health effects of medical marijuana laws, mandatory seat belt laws, and the Great Recession in the USA, user-fees in sub-Saharan Africa, and tobacco policies in Canada."

We introduce and formally define policy-relevant research questions based on specific causal contrasts. The course format is a mixture of didactic lectures, classroom evaluations of published evaluations, homework assignments, and student presentations. We introduce students to approaches for estimating the effects of social interventions, classified broadly as experimental or observational (quasi-experimental).

    "text": "Antenatal Steroids and Child Health\n\n\n\nPhoto: Pop Data BC\n\n\n(with Jennifer Hutcheon and Erin Strumpf)\nRATIONALE: Randomized clinical trials have consistently shown that administering antenatal corticosteroids to pregnant women at risk of preterm delivery can reduce neonatal mortality, respiratory morbidity, and other adverse birth outcomes. Yet, use of this proven treatment remains sub-optimal in Canadian clinical practice, with as many as 40% of eligible preterm births at 24-33 weeks’ gestation not receiving antenatal corticosteroids as recommended in Canadian and international practice guidelines.\nOne important factor contributing to low antenatal corticosteroids use is the lack of rigorous data on their longer-term safety for child health. There is no clear evidence of adverse effects, but signals of harm from selected animal and human studies have created concerns that antenatal corticosteroids may impair child neurodevelopment. However, all of these studies are low quality. Follow-up studies of randomized trials were hampered by low follow-up rates and small sample sizes, and observational studies were highly susceptible to confounding. High-quality evidence on the longer-term safety of antenatal corticosteroids for child neurodevelopment is critical for optimizing use of this medication.\nWhen randomization is infeasible, regression discontinuity studies can provide evidence on the causal effects of a drug or exposure. The design exploits differences in clinical care among individuals immediately on either side of a clinical or policy cut-point as a pseudo-randomization tool. With antenatal corticosteroids, clinical practice guidelines recommend administration up to 33+6 weeks’ gestation (33 weeks, 6 days) – but not one day later, at 34+0 weeks. This (somewhat) arbitrary cut-off means that infants born as little as hours apart have substantially different chances of receiving this effective treatment. Using preliminary data from over 8500 preterm births in British Columbia, we have shown that regression discontinuity analysis can replicate the clinical trial findings on short-term neonatal respiratory morbidity. We propose to now link our cohort with child development outcomes, and use this novel design to generate rigorous evidence on the longer-term safety of antenatal steroids.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine if antenatal corticosteroid administration decreases kindergarten child development scores (primary outcome) or increases risks of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes such cerebral palsy or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nAPPROACH: We will use a population-based cohort of 12,653 preterm births from British Columbia, Canada, 2000-2013. Obstetrical and neonatal medical records contained in the BC Perinatal Data Registry will be linked with provincial school child development assessments, hospitalization, prescription, and physician visit data. Our primary outcome will be child development scores based on the Early Development Instrument, a validated tool routinely administered by kindergarten teachers across Canada and internationally. International classification of diseases codes and prescriptions will be used to identify our secondary outcomes of cerebral palsy and ADHD. We will use a regression discontinuity design to estimate the effect of antenatal corticosteroids on outcomes among infants born on either side of the 34+0 weeks’ cut-point within a narrow gestational age window.\nPUBLIC HEALTH IMPORTANCE: Preterm birth is the single most important cause of neonatal mortality and severe morbidity in Canada, and costs the Canadian health care system over $8 billion per year. Antenatal corticosteroids can reduce this burden of disease by 30% for as low as $1 per dose, but the unknown potential for longer-term harm hinders their use in clinical practice. Our findings will inform evidence-based Canadian clinical practice guidelines that address the potential longer-term harms associated with antenatal corticosteroids. This will enable physicians to optimize use of this treatment with proven neonatal benefits that may currently be being avoided unnecessarily.\nFunding: Canadian Institutes for Health Research"

    "text": "Affordable Daycare To Empower Indian Women\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: Arijit Nandi\n\n\n(with Arijit Nandi)\nThere are structural barriers to women’s empowerment in India. Among these barriers is the lack of affordable and reliable day-care services. The responsibility of providing childcare is imposed primarily on women and contributes to gender inequalities experienced by women over the life-course. The provision of affordable and reliable day-care services is a potentially important policy lever for empowering Indian women. Access to day-care might reduce barriers to labor force entry and generate economic opportunities for women. However, empirical evidence concerning the effects of day-care programs in low-and-middle-income countries is scarce. We propose a cluster-randomized impact evaluation for estimating the effect of a community-based day-care program on empowerment, economic opportunity, and health among mothers living in rural Rajasthan, India. This interdisciplinary research initiative will address an important research gap and has the potential to inform policies for improving the day-care system in India in ways that promote inclusive economic growth.\nFunding: International Development Research Centre\nThe video below provides some additional details about the project and some essential context for where this work is being done."

The aim of this program is to reduce maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity by improving the availability of quality maternal and newborn healthcare services. Activities include: training and mentoring of Regional and District Council Health Management Teams (R/CHMTs) in data management and usage, supply chain management, budgeting and leadership; development of an emergency transportation system; refurbishing health centre and hospital maternity wards and procuring Basic Emergency Obstetric and Newborn CARE (BEmONC) and Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Newborn CARE (CEmONC) equipment; training and mentoring of health care workers (HCWs) on BEmONC, CEmONC and family planning; and training and support of Community Health Workers (CHWs) to deliver quality maternal and newborn health education and promote utilization of health care services. We will be assessing the program’s impacts by integrating monitoring and evaluation with the delivery of interventions using a randomized phase-in or “stepped wedge” design.\nFunding: Global Affairs Canada"

Missing the Trees for the Forest\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, life expectancy in the United States has stagnated, followed by three consecutive years of decline. The decline is small in absolute terms but is unprecedented and has generated considerable research interest and theorizing about potential causes. Recent trends show that the decline has affected nearly all race/ethnic and gender groups, and the proximate causes of the decline are increases in opioid overdose deaths, suicide, homicide, and Alzheimer’s disease. A slowdown in the long-term decline in mortality from cardiovascular diseases has also prevented life expectancy from improving further. Although a popular explanation for the decline is the cumulative decline in living standards across generations, recent trends suggest that distinct mechanisms for specific causes of death are more plausible explanations. Interventions to stem the increase in overdose deaths, reduce access to mechanisms that contribute to violent deaths, and decrease cardiovascular risk over the life course are urgently needed to improve mortality in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

To facilitate student engagement with the reading we will use the online tool Perusall for all required readings. Perusall is a reading platform in which students (and faculty) annotate texts collaboratively alongside one another. More information on how Perusall works and how it is integrated into the course is available here (thank you Arizona State!). To access Perusall through MyCourses, navigate to Content &gt; Readings &gt; Perusall, and then click the “Open Link” button. This will take you to the Perusall site and automatically register you as a member of the course. If you are having any trouble accessing the readings through Perusall contact me right away. I will not be using Perusall’s grading features, but I expect you to read, post questions, respond to other students questions and answers, and to take an active role in generating productive discussion."

Toward that end, over the course of the semester you will be asked to submit one original, critical essay that explores a topic of relevance to epidemiologic science. It may be a direct response to material that we read or discuss in class, or it may be an essay exploring other topics relevant to your work that demonstrate a good-faith effort to engage with the class material. These should take the form of a commentary similar (in spirit) to those we have read during the semester, and should be no longer than 2500 words. An outline of the essay, including the basic arguments you want to make, is due on March 10, 2023 and the final essay is due on April 19, 2023. I will provide examples of what I think are good pieces of writing to aspire to."

    "text": "4.3 Engagement\n\nLeading Discussion\nIn addition to the writing assignment, each student will be asked to lead at least one day of discussion among the topics that we will cover (and probably more than one for most of you). For that session, you will come prepared to briefly summarize the material we have read, and to prepare some discussion points to help keep the conversation moving. I have created a Google spreadsheet with the current days for each topic here. Please sign-up for a session and we can have a discussion about the readings and where to draw on other resources for the topic. Note: We have 25 sessions and 14 students this year, so not everyone is required to lead 2 sessions. You should be able to sort this out, but if the remaining slots don’t get filled I will happily assign them.\nAlthough each class session is 1.5 hours, there will inevitably be topics that come up that we can’t fully address in class. I encourage you to use the Discussion section of MyCourses to post questions or comments there. In past years I have also used this as a place to occassionally post links to additional readings for those interested.\n\n\nParticipation\nReal engagement means active participation. This can take many forms, but for some general guidance, this means:\n\nShowing up for each class having read and engaged with the material assigned. It will help facilitate discussion if you could aim to contribute at least 2-3 points for discussion or questions about the material in Perusall, and bring those to class;\nFocusing during class discussion and avoiding distractions, and being present and intellectually engaged during the discussion;\nAsking questions about anything in the readings that seems unclear or objectionable (in class, outside class, online). This can include both specific ideas from the readings, as well as synthesizing or finding themes common to different readings or our discussion;\nOffering respectful arguments and responses, and respectfully listening to the arguments and responses of others. Contributions should be relevant and helpful and demonstrate that you are engaging with the material being discussed at the time, and that you are well-prepared for class."

I hope you find it helpful.\n\nWednesday 2023-01-04: Course introduction\n\nAdministrative aspects of the course.\nRound table – introductions.\nDiscussion of objectives and competencies.\n\nIn the first session we will talk generally about high-level questions regarding the discipline of epidemiology as a whole. Although you are early on in your training, I think it is valuable for you to be aware of these broader discussions about where the field stands in relation to its past, and what the appropriate balance should be between descriptive, causal, or implementation questions. Having some knowledge about the intellectual history of different concepts (“risk factor epidemiology”, “consequential epidemiology”) will help you to figure out where your own work stands in relation to the discipline as a whole.\n\n\nFriday 2023-01-06: Reflections on epidemiology’s past and present\n\nWhat:\n\nDavey Smith G. Post–Modern Epidemiology: When Methods Meet Matter. Am J Epidemiol 2019;188(8):1410–1419. [link] [8601 words]\nLesko CR, Keil AP, Edwards JK. The Epidemiologic Toolbox: Identifying, Honing, and Using the Right Tools for the Job. Am J Epidemiol 2020;189(6):511–517. [link] [3675 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThe Davey Smith paper provides a bit of historical orientation to the ‘modern’ epidemiology training you are getting, as well as a critique of it in relation to epidemiology’s past. I chose the Lesko et al. paper because it focuses on the relationship between the tools of epidemiology (about which you are learning a lot in this first year) and the kinds of questions that can be answered with those tools. In particular, they focus on differences between purely descriptive questions, questions about synthesized evidence on causal relationships, and questions about specific interventions for which we want to estimate a causal effect. I also like that it was written by early career researchers whose training is in many ways similar to your own."

    "text": "6.2 Week 2: What kinds of questions should we be asking?\nAsking good questions is central to advancing epidemiologic knowledge, but what makes a question ‘good’? Is ‘novelty’ more important than making incremental progress? Should it matter whether a given question will produce ‘actionable’ evidence? And is it problematic if a study’s methods are not well aligned with the question it seeks to answer? Is it wasteful (or, even unethical) to produce such work?\n\nWednesday 2023-01-11: Does it matter whether questions and methods align?\n\nWhat:\n\nFox MP, Murray EJ, Lesko CR, Sealy-Jefferson S. On the Need to Revitalize Descriptive Epidemiology. Am J of Epidemiol 2022;191(7):1174–9. [link] [4263 words]\nHernan MA, Hsu J, Healy B. A Second Chance to Get Causal Inference Right: A Classification of Data Science Tasks. CHANCE 2019; 32:1, 42-49. [link] [5650 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nWhat is the relationship between research questions and methods? Should we just use multivariable regression for everything? Does it actually matter? Fox et al. argue for the importance and need to reinvigorate descriptive epidemiology, and make a case that this has particular consequences for both theory and methods. The paper by Hernan and colleagues tries to lay out how questions and methods should be aligned in empirical data science research. This paper was written when enthusiasm for machine learning and other empirical data science algorithms began achieving a high degree of influence, and their paper aims to try and clarify the utility of being clear about the question being asked, the methods used to answer it, and the role of expert knowledge in generating the result.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-01-13: What makes a ‘good’ question?\n\nWhat:\n\nBanack H.

[link] [1876 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThe paper by Fox et al. and the podcast by Banack and Fox (with apologies in advance for the volume of terribly corny epidemiology jokes contain therein) are meant to get you thinking about how to orient your own research around choosing questions to answer and how to think critically about the inevitable tradeoffs that come with doing research. How will you decide what questions to answer with your work, and how will you evaluate the questions others are asking?"

    "section": "6.3 Week 3: How important is formal causal inference?",
    "text": "6.3 Week 3: How important is formal causal inference?\nMuch of modern epidemiologic training now starts with the introduction of potential outcomes framework, as well as introducing DAGs as a way to draw and consider assumptions needed for doing causal inference. What are the implications of using these frameworks for the kinds of questions that can be asked and answered in epidemiology? Do we risk restricting ourselves to ‘formal’ methods when it comes to causal questions, or are other alternatives possible? These are fundamental questions about the nature of epidemiologic inquiry, and it is useful for you to consider the benefits and drawbacks that may come with adopting this epistemological stance. As you progress in your training, you’ll need to decide on how you will approach questions of causal inference both in your own work and in your evaluations of the wider epidemiologic literature.\n\nWednesday 2023-01-18: Are potential outcomes and DAGs necessary?\n\nWhat:\n\nKrieger N, Davey Smith G. The tale wagged by the DAG: broadening the scope of causal inference and explanation for epidemiology. Int J Epidemiol. 2016 12;45(6):1787–1808.

Int J Epidemiol. 2016 12;45(6):1817–1829. [link] [10561 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThe first set of papers for this session come from an older, but still relevant “debate” about the utility and consequences of the “formal” approach to causal inference in epidemiology, which you likely now take for granted, since that is what most ‘modern’ epi programs teach (including ours). Krieger/Davey Smith are asking critical questions of potential outcomes and DAGs (the latter was also the editor at IJE at the time, hence the ‘relaxed’ approach to word limits), and Daniel et al. defending, more or less the modern approach. Look forward to hearing your thoughts.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-01-20: Are well-defined interventions needed for causal questions?\n\nWhat:\n\nSchwartz S, Gatto NM, Campbell UB. Causal identification: a charge of epidemiology in danger of marginalization. Ann Epidemiol 2016;26(10):669-673. [link]. [4069 words]\nHernan MA. Does water kill?

Heeding the call for less casual causal inferences: the utility of realized (quantitative) causal effects. Ann Epidemiol 2017;27(6):402-405. [link]. [2756 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThe second set of readings for this week is meant to engage with a more specific critique of ‘modern’ causal inference methods, namely, the notion that ‘good’ causal questions are based on well-defined interventions. This is a more recent argument, largely associated with Miguel Hernan and linked to the idea of using ‘target trials’ to formulate questions for observational studies.\nAs academics are wont to do, there has been some pushback against this idea, notably by Sharon Schwartz, another long-term and thoughtful critic of epidemiology (see her nice 1999 pre-causal-inference-revolution paper in Am J Public Health on the consequences of what she called, ‘Type III error’ which is about asking the wrong question). She and other critics are pushing back against this idea and trying to understand it’s implications (again) for the kinds of causal questions we can answer (and note that I think this is a different sort of critique than was being made by Krieger/Davey Smith)."

    "text": "6.4 Week 4: How should we study non-manipulable exposures?\nLongstanding debates about whether exposures that are not directly (or perhaps even theoretically) manipulable, such as race, ethnicity, sex, or country-of-birth, present important challenges for the counterfactual models of causal inference you have been learning about. This set of readings aims to try and clarify some of these conceptual questions and derive potential paths forward that respect the “rules” of causal inference but that can also provide evidence that may be useful for reducing differences in health across non-manipulable factors.\n\nWednesday 2023-01-25: Are non-manipulable exposures causes?\n\nWhat:\n\nVanderWeele TJ, Robinson WR.

[link] [2378 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThe paper by Vanderweele and Robinson tries to address the issue of non-manipulable exposures (specifically race) in a way that respects the complexity of this kind of exposure, but attempts to move forward to see whether it is helpful to reframe the question to how interventions on factors plausibly affected by race may affect racial differences in health. Meanwhile, Glymour and Spiegelman offer more of a defense of the idea that non-manipulable factors are causes and deserve the same kind of consideration and treatment as other exposures we study routinely in epidemiology. Finally, the blog post by Boyd is a relatively new piece making strong arguments for how race should be reported and interpreted in epidemiologic and clinical studies.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-01-27: Case study: race in clinical treatment.\n\nWhat:\n\nVyas DA, Eisenstein LG, Jones DS. Hidden in Plain Sight — Reconsidering the Use of Race Correction in Clinical Algorithms. New Engl J Med 2020;383(9):874–82. [link] [6251 words]\nManski CF. Patient-centered appraisal of race-free clinical risk assessment. Health Econ 2022;31(10):2109–14. [link] [4133 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nTaking a bit of a break from conceptual readings on questions and causal inference, in the second session we delve into a case study of the challenges in the use of race in clinical medicine. Should we use race as a factor in recommending treatments to patients? Does it matter whether or not race is a cause of the outcome, or whether including race might affect inequalities? The two papers from Vyas et al. and Manski arrive at different arguments regarding whether or not race should be included, and I think they provide a rich set of issues to discuss that complement the arguments about how we should study non-manipulable exposures in epidemiology."

    "text": "6.5 Week 5: Should we try to randomize interventions?\nOkay, we’ve talked about the role of asking good questions, whether non-manipulable factors are causes and ways to investigate them, and whether we need well-specified interventions for causal questions, but let’s now turn toward more practical concerns (ha). You want to study intervention \\(X\\), which is not known to be either harmful or beneficial, can be ethically and feasibly delivered, and has plausible reasons why it should affect \\(Y\\). What kind of design should you use? Should you try and design a randomized evaluation? What would be the benefits? What drawbacks? What implications for external generalizability or understanding the mechanisms through which it may affect \\(Y\\)?\n\nWednesday 2023-02-01: Are RCT’s special?\n\nWhat:\n\nDeaton A, Cartwright N. Understanding and misunderstanding randomized controlled trials. Soc Sci Med 2018;210:2–21. [link] [22882 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nDeaton and Cartwright’s paper provides an overview of core philosophical, conceptual, and statistical concepts of randomized trials, and a lot of comments on their benefits and drawbacks. Haushofer and Metcalf apply questions about the feasibility to our pandemic circumstances (though it seems a long time ago that they published this in May of 2020, before viable vaccines, before new strains, before second, third, omicron waves). As epidemiologists, I think you will benefit from getting into the weeds a bit about randomized designs and grappling with questions about when and where they might be appropriate.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-02-03: What if we can’t randomize?\n\nWhat:\n\nLodi S, Phillips A, Lundgren J, Logan R, Sharma S, Cole SR, et al. Effect Estimates in Randomized Trials and Observational Studies: Comparing Apples With Apples. Am J Epidemiol 2019 08;188(8):1569–1577. [link] [3044 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nDespite some important strengths of randomized designs, especially for exchangeability, in some cases it just won’t be feasible or ethical to pursue a randomized design. What then? Anything goes? Just plug all the confounders into your regression and hope for the best? There are still good reasons to consider thinking conceptually about the trial you would design if feasibility and ethical issues were irrelevant, and then attempting to pursue an observational design that corresponds as closely as possible to your hypothetical “target trial”.\nLodi et al. are really focused on comparing results from an observational study to a trial that both investigate the same question, and their paper shows a practical example of how you might think about approaching this question (I would say even if you don’t have trial data). Nevertheless, this design still focuses almost entirely on regression adjustment as a way of achieving exchangeability–a rather strong assumption, and one that may be difficult to sell to critics."

    "text": "6.6 Week 6: Do we need representative samples?\nOkay, so now suppose that we’ve decided on a question and a (randomized or non-randomized) design. Who should be in our sample? It is important that we obtain a random sample of our target population, or can we use a convenience sample? And how does this change depending on the goal of our study, i.e., to estimate a prevalence versus develop a prediction model versus estimate a causal effect?\n\nWednesday 2023-02-08: Should our studies be representative?\n\nWhat:\n\nRothman KJ, Gallacher JEJ, Hatch EE.

Epidemiology 2021;32:179–188. [link] [6921 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nDebates about whether studies designed to estimate causal effects need to be representative, or alternatively should purposefully be designed not to be representative, have been persistent in epidemiology, but have also become more pressing given increasing concerns for generalizability. This paper by Rothman arguing that causal studies should avoid representative samples created a bit of a stir a few years ago, and has produced some additional empirical work on how much this matters. These issues are important for when you are both producing and consuming research, and it will be worthwhile to struggle a bit with them. I’ve also included a recent empirical piece that attempts to assess the quantitative consequences for a specific set of exposures and outcomes.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-02-10: Case study: COVID-19 vaccine uptake\n\nWhat:\n\nBradley VC et al. Unrepresentative Big Surveys Significantly Overestimated US Vaccine Uptake. Nature 2021;600:695–700. [link] [11400 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nOnce again, let’s take a break and delve into a case study regarding the importance (or non-importance) of representative samples. Do the consequences actually matter? A very recent paper by Bradley on vaccine uptake surveys provides an example to discuss in the second session."

    "text": "6.7 Week 7: How should we make statistical inferences?\nThis question probably won’t go away over the course of your PhD training, or in the near future, so it is important to grapple with it. What are the consequences of the way we currently teach and use p-values (or 95% confidence intervals), how does it affect the way you read and interpret evidence? Should we banish the term “statistically significant” and, if so, why? How will you argue against peer reviewers and journal editors (or even your supervisors) that demand you include p-values (or, even worse, stars for levels of ‘significance’) in your revisions? This is a core issue of moving from sampled data and analysis to the kind of inferences you will make about causal effects. How will you approach it?\n\nThursday Wednesday 2023-02-15: How should we use p-values?\n\nWhat:\n\nWasserstein RL, Schirm AL, Lazar NA. Moving to a world beyond “p&lt;0.05”. The American Statistician 2019;73(sup1):1–19. [link]. [10923 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nWasserstein et al. provide a series of arguments for abandoning p-value thresholds, some of which you are likely to have heard before, but there is much more in this paper. They make a number of positive arguments for how we should be conducting inference, and interpreting the results of research, and they aim to try and provide solid foundations for being more thoughtful about how to interpret evidence.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-02-17: What are alternatives to p-values?\n\nWhat:\n\nGreenland S, Mansournia MA, Joffe M. To curb research misreporting, replace significance and confidence by compatibility. Prev Med 2022;164:107127. [link] [4493 words]\nHarhay MO, Blette BS, Granholm A, Moler FW, Zampieri FG, Goligher EC, et al. A Bayesian Interpretation of a Pediatric Cardiac Arrest Trial (THAPCA-OH). NEJM Evidence. 2022;2(1):EVIDoa2200196. [link] [7203 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nGiven the Wasserstein paper’s suggestion to abandon statistical significance, questions naturally arise about how we should do inference instead of using p-values. Most epidemiologists are trained to use confidence intervals rather than p-values, but it does not appear to have changed the basic problem of scientists dichotomizing evidence using arbitrary statistical rules. These papers attempt to provide some alternative avenues to explore. Greenland et al. continue their quest to promote notions of ‘compatibility’ rather than significance. I included the Harhay et al. paper because it shows how to provide a more nuanced interpretation of a ‘non-significant’ RCT using straightforward Bayesian inference. This should get you thinking about how you will manage your inferences in your own research"

    "text": "6.8 Week 8: How bad can it be?\nThis week’s readings move beyond inference on the main quantitative question or hypothesis of interest and are focused on concepts and methods relevant to testing and probing the assumptions needed to interpret quantitative evidence. These ideas are crucial for thinking about testing alternative explanations for observed findings, and quantifying the assumptions needed to do so.\n\nWednesday 2023-02-22: How can we quantify our assumptions?\n\nWhat:\n\nLash TL, Fox MP, MacLehose RF, Maldonado G, McCandless LC, Greenland S. Good practices for quantitative bias analysis. Int J Epidemiol 2014;43(6):1969–85. [link] [12518 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nLash et al. provide a long overview of good practices for such bias analysis, discussing both the motivation for why one would want to to conduct bias analysis and the mechanics of how to do so (choosing parameters, considering uncertainty). These methods are valuable for most study designs, but may be especially so for “garden variety” observational studies that must rely on basic regression adjustment to have any hope of making causal inferences.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-02-24: Can bias analysis be biased?\n\nWhat:\n\nLash TL, Ahern TP, Collin LJ, Fox MP, MacLehose RF.

[link] [2191 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nAlthough sensitivity analysis has been around a long time, quantitative bias analysis continues to be rare, and perhaps one explanation is that it asks a lot from researchers. Other options may include using simple bounds to answer questions about how bad things would have to be to ‘nullify’ an effect, but replacing ignoring assumptions with absurd assumptions leaves much to be desired. Lash et al. demonstrate how to do bias analysis ‘better’ and what can go wrong when it is not done with care. Gustafson, in a comment on some other papers, provides an interesting hypothetical set of scenarios for different ways of combining different study designs and strategies for accounting for bias. I hope you can come away with an appreciation and understanding of why such analyses are valuable."

This week, we are moving on to thinking about the question of to whom our study results should apply. These are core questions that come up in the context of evaluating strengths and weaknesses of studies in peer review (or perhaps grant review), and whether the results of studies may provide actionable evidence.\n\nWednesday 2023-03-08: How should we think about generalizing to other populations?\n\nWhat:\n\nLesko CR, Buchanan AL, Westreich D, Edwards JK, Hudgens MG, Cole SR.

Target Validity and the Hierarchy of Study Designs. Am J Epidemiol 2019;188:438–443. [link] [5308 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nDespite the clear importance of considering to whom study results should apply, there has been little formal work on what assumptions are needed to derive quantitative estimates of effects in different external populations, whether those refer to the target population or a population that is external to the target. These two papers argue that we should consider these formal approaches, and provide some guidance as to what assumptions (and potentially data) would be needed to do so.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-03-10: Should we generalize to specific individuals?\n\nWhat:\n\nKhoury, MJ et al. The Intersection of Genomics and Big Data with Public Health: Opportunities for Precision Public Health.

[link] [6793 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThe second part of our readings on extending results to other populations reframes the question not about transporting results to a different sample, but about how to (and whether we can) derive reliable predictions about treatment effects at the individual level. This is related to ongoing discussions about the concepts of “precision” epidemiology or precision public health, and whether these ideas are really novel or just ways of re-branding what we have always considered in public health, which is targeting when it comes to interventions. There have emerged different ‘camps’ of those more and less enthusiastic about this idea, and these two papers are meant to provide an overview of some of these issues."

[link] [9180 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThe second session features a long paper by Munafo et al. that is more focused on outlining and describing some potential solutions, including study pre-registration and pre-analysis plan, registered reports or ‘results-blind’ peer review, sharing of research materials, including data and code, and changing incentives around publication and grants - all core processes for modern working scientists."

    "text": "6.12 Week 12: How should we put together all of the evidence?\nThis week we are going to talk more about how to put together and think about diverse lines of evidence to come to some sort of judgement about causal effects. Most of you will have heard (and I agree) that it a single study is unlikely to be sufficient to generate certainty about a given exposure-outcome effect. There may be special circumstances (e.g, vaccine trials for COVID-19), but generally we are starting from a place where we have to consider various lines of argument and evidence to inform our thinking.\n\nWednesday 2023-03-22: Can “triangulation” help?\n\nWhat:\n\nLawlor DA, Tilling K, Davey Smith G. Triangulation in aetiological epidemiology. Int J Epidemiol 2016;45(6):1866–86. [link] [14610 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nYou may have seen various papers talk about the concept of ‘triangulation’ in thinking about evidence. The Lawlor et al. paper focuses on trying to pull together (sometimes by design) data sources that may trade off different kinds of biases in order to see whether results are consistent across various settings, but in a formal and methodological way. I encourage you to consider whether you think it is a useful approach.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-03-24: Does meta-analysis help or hurt?\n\nWhat:\n\nHilton Boon M, Burns J, Craig P, Griebler U, Heise TL, Vittal Katikireddi S, et al. Value and Challenges of Using Observational Studies in Systematic Reviews of Public Health Interventions. Am J Public Health 2022;112(4):548–52. [link] [3899 words]\nSavitz DA, Forastiere F. Do pooled estimates from meta-analyses of observational epidemiology studies contribute to causal inference? Occup Environ Med 2021;78(9):621–2. [link] [2029 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nMeta-analysis of a systematic review has become the dominant method for summarizing epidemiologic evidence, but comes with a large set of challenges, particularly for observational studies. These two papers provide an overview of some of the challenges of how these contribute to evidence, and whether they are ultimately useful for informing causal inference about the effects of exposures."

    "section": "6.13 Week 13: How should we communicate epidemiologic evidence?",
    "text": "6.13 Week 13: How should we communicate epidemiologic evidence?\nThis week we will be reading more about the (possible) tension between our duties as epidemiologic scientists to try and report evidence in a dispassionate way, and the sometimes pressing need for action to tackle pressing health problems when evidence is uncertain. The readings are from two seasoned epidemiologists and provide some overarching guidance thinking about how far to ‘push’ with your results, and what the benefits and drawbacks of different levels of engagement with the broader scientific community might be.\n\nWednesday 2023-03-29: How should we discuss epidemiologic results?\n\nWhat:\n\nSavitz DA, Wellenius GA. Characterization and Communication of Conclusions. In: Interpreting epidemiologic evidence: connecting research to applications. Oxford University Press; 2016. p. 200–10. [link] [5958 words]\nBlastland M et al. Five rules for evidence communication. Nature 2020;587:362–364 [link] [2664 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThe second session’s readings are focused more on how to grapple with and communicate uncertainty in epidemiologic findings, both to other scientists (e.g., in peer-reviewed papers) and to the public or to other stakeholders. The chapter by Savitz and Wellenius provides some high-level guidance and advice to epidemiologists about their duties to describe evidence in a dispassionate way, but also to make good faith efforts to distill findings in ways suitably tailored for different audiences. Some additional discussion of how to consider biases across different studies when synthesizing evidence is also included. The piece by Blastland et al. is more direct in providing advice to scientists on how to communicate about evidence, largely arguing that our duties are to be transparent in reporting, especially about uncertainty, rather than attempting to persuade or change opinions.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-03-31: How much does “evidence” even matter?\n\nWhat:\n\nGreenhalgh T. Miasmas, Mental Models and Preventive Public Health: Some Philosophical Reflections on Science in the COVID-19 Pandemic. Interface Focus 2021;11: 1-8. [link] [7602 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nGreenhalgh uses the twin examples of the 19th century cholera epidemics in England and the present pandemic to talk about the role of ‘extra-scientific’ values in shaping how we view and decide on what kind of ‘evidence’ is compelling, and ties this to current (and ongoing) debates regarding the use of evidence in the COVID-19 pandemic."

This creates a kind of cultural inertia in science that has produced important advances, but also creates problems. Can we change the culture to improve the way epidemiology is working today? This last session asks you to consider this question.\n\nWhat:\n\nMathur MB, Fox MP. Toward open and reproducible epidemiology. Am J Epidemiol (forthcoming) [link] [5823 words]\nLakens D. Is my study useless? Why researchers need methodological review boards. Nature 2023;613(7942):9–9. [link] [977 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThese two papers aim to argue for adopting larger scale innovations in social sciences (including epidemiology). Mathur and Fox make a strong case for greater openness and transparency, specifically in epidemiology. Lakens (a psychologist) makes a case that ethical review boards have an obligation to consider whether proposed research is capable of producing reliable evidence, and suggests they should have the power to intervene to stop work that has a low probability of providing reliable evidence.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-04-07: No class (Good Friday)"

Toward that end, over the course of the semester you will be asked to submit two critical essays that explore a topic of relevance to epidemiologic science.These may be direct responses to material that we read or discuss in class, or they may be essays exploring other topics relevant to your work that demonstrate good-faith efforts to engage with the class material. These should take the form of a commentary similar (in spirit) to those we have read during the semester, and should be no longer than 1500 words. The first one is due on October 22, 2020 and the second one is due on December 7, 2020. I will provide examples of what I think are good pieces of writing to aspire to.\n\n\nClass Participation\nIn addition to the writing assignment, each student will be asked to lead one day of discussion among the topics that we will cover. For that session, you will come prepared to briefly summarize the material we have read, and to prepare some discussion points to help keep the conversation moving. I have created a Google spreadsheet with the current days for each topic here. Please sign-up for a session and we can have a discussion about the readings and where to draw on other resources for the topic."
