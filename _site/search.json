    "text": "Antenatal Steroids and Child Health\n\n\n\nPhoto: Pop Data BC\n\n\n(with Jennifer Hutcheon and Erin Strumpf)\nRATIONALE: Randomized clinical trials have consistently shown that administering antenatal corticosteroids to pregnant women at risk of preterm delivery can reduce neonatal mortality, respiratory morbidity, and other adverse birth outcomes. Yet, use of this proven treatment remains sub-optimal in Canadian clinical practice, with as many as 40% of eligible preterm births at 24-33 weeks’ gestation not receiving antenatal corticosteroids as recommended in Canadian and international practice guidelines.\nOne important factor contributing to low antenatal corticosteroids use is the lack of rigorous data on their longer-term safety for child health. There is no clear evidence of adverse effects, but signals of harm from selected animal and human studies have created concerns that antenatal corticosteroids may impair child neurodevelopment. However, all of these studies are low quality. Follow-up studies of randomized trials were hampered by low follow-up rates and small sample sizes, and observational studies were highly susceptible to confounding. High-quality evidence on the longer-term safety of antenatal corticosteroids for child neurodevelopment is critical for optimizing use of this medication.\nWhen randomization is infeasible, regression discontinuity studies can provide evidence on the causal effects of a drug or exposure. The design exploits differences in clinical care among individuals immediately on either side of a clinical or policy cut-point as a pseudo-randomization tool. With antenatal corticosteroids, clinical practice guidelines recommend administration up to 33+6 weeks’ gestation (33 weeks, 6 days) – but not one day later, at 34+0 weeks. This (somewhat) arbitrary cut-off means that infants born as little as hours apart have substantially different chances of receiving this effective treatment. Using preliminary data from over 8500 preterm births in British Columbia, we have shown that regression discontinuity analysis can replicate the clinical trial findings on short-term neonatal respiratory morbidity. We propose to now link our cohort with child development outcomes, and use this novel design to generate rigorous evidence on the longer-term safety of antenatal steroids.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine if antenatal corticosteroid administration decreases kindergarten child development scores (primary outcome) or increases risks of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes such cerebral palsy or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nAPPROACH: We will use a population-based cohort of 12,653 preterm births from British Columbia, Canada, 2000-2013. Obstetrical and neonatal medical records contained in the BC Perinatal Data Registry will be linked with provincial school child development assessments, hospitalization, prescription, and physician visit data. Our primary outcome will be child development scores based on the Early Development Instrument, a validated tool routinely administered by kindergarten teachers across Canada and internationally. International classification of diseases codes and prescriptions will be used to identify our secondary outcomes of cerebral palsy and ADHD. We will use a regression discontinuity design to estimate the effect of antenatal corticosteroids on outcomes among infants born on either side of the 34+0 weeks’ cut-point within a narrow gestational age window.\nPUBLIC HEALTH IMPORTANCE: Preterm birth is the single most important cause of neonatal mortality and severe morbidity in Canada, and costs the Canadian health care system over $8 billion per year. Antenatal corticosteroids can reduce this burden of disease by 30% for as low as $1 per dose, but the unknown potential for longer-term harm hinders their use in clinical practice. Our findings will inform evidence-based Canadian clinical practice guidelines that address the potential longer-term harms associated with antenatal corticosteroids. This will enable physicians to optimize use of this treatment with proven neonatal benefits that may currently be being avoided unnecessarily.\nFunding: Canadian Institutes for Health Research"

    "text": "Affordable Daycare To Empower Indian Women\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: Arijit Nandi\n\n\n(with Arijit Nandi)\nThere are structural barriers to women’s empowerment in India. Among these barriers is the lack of affordable and reliable day-care services. The responsibility of providing childcare is imposed primarily on women and contributes to gender inequalities experienced by women over the life-course. The provision of affordable and reliable day-care services is a potentially important policy lever for empowering Indian women. Access to day-care might reduce barriers to labor force entry and generate economic opportunities for women. However, empirical evidence concerning the effects of day-care programs in low-and-middle-income countries is scarce. We propose a cluster-randomized impact evaluation for estimating the effect of a community-based day-care program on empowerment, economic opportunity, and health among mothers living in rural Rajasthan, India. This interdisciplinary research initiative will address an important research gap and has the potential to inform policies for improving the day-care system in India in ways that promote inclusive economic growth.\nFunding: International Development Research Centre\nThe video below provides some additional details about the project and some essential context for where this work is being done."

For that session, you will come prepared to briefly summarize the material we have read, and to prepare some discussion points to help keep the conversation moving. I have created a Google spreadsheet with the current days for each topic here. Please sign-up for a session and we can have a discussion about the readings and where to draw on other resources for the topic. Note: We have 25 sessions and 14 students this year, so not everyone is required to lead 2 sessions. You should be able to sort this out, but if the remaining slots don’t get filled I will happily assign them.\nAlthough each class session is 1.5 hours, there will inevitably be topics that come up that we can’t fully address in class. I encourage you to use the Discussion section of MyCourses to post questions or comments there. In past years I have also used this as a place to occassionally post links to additional readings for those interested.\n\n\nParticipation\nReal engagement means active participation. This can take many forms, but for some general guidance, this means:\n\nShowing up for each class having read and engaged with the material assigned. It will help facilitate discussion if you could aim to contribute at least 2-3 points for discussion or questions about the material in Perusall, and bring those to class;\nFocusing during class discussion and avoiding distractions, and being present and intellectually engaged during the discussion;\nAsking questions about anything in the readings that seems unclear or objectionable (in class, outside class, online). This can include both specific ideas from the readings, as well as synthesizing or finding themes common to different readings or our discussion;\nOffering respectful arguments and responses, and respectfully listening to the arguments and responses of others. Contributions should be relevant and helpful and demonstrate that you are engaging with the material being discussed at the time, and that you are well-prepared for class."

For each set of assigned material (the ‘What’), I’ve included a brief rationale (the ‘Why’). I hope you find it helpful.\n\nWednesday 2023-01-04: Course introduction\n\nAdministrative aspects of the course.\nRound table – introductions.\nDiscussion of objectives and competencies.\n\nIn the first session we will talk generally about high-level questions regarding the discipline of epidemiology as a whole. Although you are early on in your training, I think it is valuable for you to be aware of these broader discussions about where the field stands in relation to its past, and what the appropriate balance should be between descriptive, causal, or implementation questions. Having some knowledge about the intellectual history of different concepts (“risk factor epidemiology”, “consequential epidemiology”) will help you to figure out where your own work stands in relation to the discipline as a whole.\n\n\nFriday 2023-01-06: Reflections on epidemiology’s past and present\n\nWhat:\n\nDavey Smith G.

I chose the Lesko et al. paper because it focuses on the relationship between the tools of epidemiology (about which you are learning a lot in this first year) and the kinds of questions that can be answered with those tools. In particular, they focus on differences between purely descriptive questions, questions about synthesized evidence on causal relationships, and questions about specific interventions for which we want to estimate a causal effect. I also like that it was written by early career researchers whose training is in many ways similar to your own."

    "text": "6.3 Week 3: How important is formal causal inference?\nMuch of modern epidemiologic training now starts with the introduction of potential outcomes framework, as well as introducing DAGs as a way to draw and consider assumptions needed for doing causal inference. What are the implications of using these frameworks for the kinds of questions that can be asked and answered in epidemiology? Do we risk restricting ourselves to ‘formal’ methods when it comes to causal questions, or are other alternatives possible? These are fundamental questions about the nature of epidemiologic inquiry, and it is useful for you to consider the benefits and drawbacks that may come with adopting this epistemological stance. As you progress in your training, you’ll need to decide on how you will approach questions of causal inference both in your own work and in your evaluations of the wider epidemiologic literature.\n\nWednesday 2023-01-18: Are potential outcomes and DAGs necessary?\n\nWhat:\n\nKrieger N, Davey Smith G.

Int J Epidemiol. 2016 12;45(6):1817–1829. [link] [10561 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThe first set of papers for this session come from an older, but still relevant “debate” about the utility and consequences of the “formal” approach to causal inference in epidemiology, which you likely now take for granted, since that is what most ‘modern’ epi programs teach (including ours). Krieger/Davey Smith are asking critical questions of potential outcomes and DAGs (the latter was also the editor at IJE at the time, hence the ‘relaxed’ approach to word limits), and Daniel et al. defending, more or less the modern approach. Look forward to hearing your thoughts.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-01-20: Are well-defined interventions needed for causal questions?\n\nWhat:\n\nSchwartz S, Gatto NM, Campbell UB.

Heeding the call for less casual causal inferences: the utility of realized (quantitative) causal effects. Ann Epidemiol 2017;27(6):402-405. [link]. [2756 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThe second set of readings for this week is meant to engage with a more specific critique of ‘modern’ causal inference methods, namely, the notion that ‘good’ causal questions are based on well-defined interventions. This is a more recent argument, largely associated with Miguel Hernan and linked to the idea of using ‘target trials’ to formulate questions for observational studies.\nAs academics are wont to do, there has been some pushback against this idea, notably by Sharon Schwartz, another long-term and thoughtful critic of epidemiology (see her nice 1999 pre-causal-inference-revolution paper in Am J Public Health on the consequences of what she called, ‘Type III error’ which is about asking the wrong question). She and other critics are pushing back against this idea and trying to understand it’s implications (again) for the kinds of causal questions we can answer (and note that I think this is a different sort of critique than was being made by Krieger/Davey Smith)."

[link] [2378 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThe paper by Vanderweele and Robinson tries to address the issue of non-manipulable exposures (specifically race) in a way that respects the complexity of this kind of exposure, but attempts to move forward to see whether it is helpful to reframe the question to how interventions on factors plausibly affected by race may affect racial differences in health. Meanwhile, Glymour and Spiegelman offer more of a defense of the idea that non-manipulable factors are causes and deserve the same kind of consideration and treatment as other exposures we study routinely in epidemiology. Finally, the blog post by Boyd is a relatively new piece making strong arguments for how race should be reported and interpreted in epidemiologic and clinical studies.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-01-27: Case study: race in clinical treatment.\n\nWhat:\n\nVyas DA, Eisenstein LG, Jones DS.

[link] [4133 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nTaking a bit of a break from conceptual readings on questions and causal inference, in the second session we delve into a case study of the challenges in the use of race in clinical medicine. Should we use race as a factor in recommending treatments to patients? Does it matter whether or not race is a cause of the outcome, or whether including race might affect inequalities? The two papers from Vyas et al. and Manski arrive at different arguments regarding whether or not race should be included, and I think they provide a rich set of issues to discuss that complement the arguments about how we should study non-manipulable exposures in epidemiology."

As epidemiologists, I think you will benefit from getting into the weeds a bit about randomized designs and grappling with questions about when and where they might be appropriate.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-02-03: What if we can’t randomize?\n\nWhat:\n\nLodi S, Phillips A, Lundgren J, Logan R, Sharma S, Cole SR, et al. Effect Estimates in Randomized Trials and Observational Studies: Comparing Apples With Apples. Am J Epidemiol 2019 08;188(8):1569–1577. [link] [3044 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nDespite some important strengths of randomized designs, especially for exchangeability, in some cases it just won’t be feasible or ethical to pursue a randomized design. What then? Anything goes? Just plug all the confounders into your regression and hope for the best? There are still good reasons to consider thinking conceptually about the trial you would design if feasibility and ethical issues were irrelevant, and then attempting to pursue an observational design that corresponds as closely as possible to your hypothetical “target trial”.\nLodi et al. are really focused on comparing results from an observational study to a trial that both investigate the same question, and their paper shows a practical example of how you might think about approaching this question (I would say even if you don’t have trial data). Nevertheless, this design still focuses almost entirely on regression adjustment as a way of achieving exchangeability–a rather strong assumption, and one that may be difficult to sell to critics."

    "text": "6.6 Week 6: Do we need representative samples?\nOkay, so now suppose that we’ve decided on a question and a (randomized or non-randomized) design. Who should be in our sample? It is important that we obtain a random sample of our target population, or can we use a convenience sample?

[link] [6921 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nDebates about whether studies designed to estimate causal effects need to be representative, or alternatively should purposefully be designed not to be representative, have been persistent in epidemiology, but have also become more pressing given increasing concerns for generalizability. This paper by Rothman arguing that causal studies should avoid representative samples created a bit of a stir a few years ago, and has produced some additional empirical work on how much this matters. These issues are important for when you are both producing and consuming research, and it will be worthwhile to struggle a bit with them. I’ve also included a recent empirical piece that attempts to assess the quantitative consequences for a specific set of exposures and outcomes.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-02-10: Case study: COVID-19 vaccine uptake\n\nWhat:\n\nBradley VC et al. Unrepresentative Big Surveys Significantly Overestimated US Vaccine Uptake. Nature 2021;600:695–700. [link] [11400 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nOnce again, let’s take a break and delve into a case study regarding the importance (or non-importance) of representative samples. Do the consequences actually matter? A very recent paper by Bradley on vaccine uptake surveys provides an example to discuss in the second session."

    "text": "6.7 Week 7: How should we make statistical inferences?\nThis question probably won’t go away over the course of your PhD training, or in the near future, so it is important to grapple with it. What are the consequences of the way we currently teach and use p-values (or 95% confidence intervals), how does it affect the way you read and interpret evidence? Should we banish the term “statistically significant” and, if so, why? How will you argue against peer reviewers and journal editors (or even your supervisors) that demand you include p-values (or, even worse, stars for levels of ‘significance’) in your revisions? This is a core issue of moving from sampled data and analysis to the kind of inferences you will make about causal effects. How will you approach it?\n\nThursday Wednesday 2023-02-15: How should we use p-values?\n\nWhat:\n\nWasserstein RL, Schirm AL, Lazar NA. Moving to a world beyond “p<0.05”. The American Statistician 2019;73(sup1):1–19. [link]. [10923 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nWasserstein et al. provide a series of arguments for abandoning p-value thresholds, some of which you are likely to have heard before, but there is much more in this paper. They make a number of positive arguments for how we should be conducting inference, and interpreting the results of research, and they aim to try and provide solid foundations for being more thoughtful about how to interpret evidence.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-02-17: What are alternatives to p-values?\n\nWhat:\n\nGreenland S, Mansournia MA, Joffe M. To curb research misreporting, replace significance and confidence by compatibility. Prev Med 2022;164:107127. [link] [4493 words]\nHarhay MO, Blette BS, Granholm A, Moler FW, Zampieri FG, Goligher EC, et al. A Bayesian Interpretation of a Pediatric Cardiac Arrest Trial (THAPCA-OH). NEJM Evidence. 2022;2(1):EVIDoa2200196. [link] [7203 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nGiven the Wasserstein paper’s suggestion to abandon statistical significance, questions naturally arise about how we should do inference instead of using p-values. Most epidemiologists are trained to use confidence intervals rather than p-values, but it does not appear to have changed the basic problem of scientists dichotomizing evidence using arbitrary statistical rules. These papers attempt to provide some alternative avenues to explore. Greenland et al. continue their quest to promote notions of ‘compatibility’ rather than significance. I included the Harhay et al. paper because it shows how to provide a more nuanced interpretation of a ‘non-significant’ RCT using straightforward Bayesian inference. This should get you thinking about how you will manage your inferences in your own research"

    "text": "6.8 Week 8: How bad can it be?\nThis week’s readings move beyond inference on the main quantitative question or hypothesis of interest and are focused on concepts and methods relevant to testing and probing the assumptions needed to interpret quantitative evidence. These ideas are crucial for thinking about testing alternative explanations for observed findings, and quantifying the assumptions needed to do so.\n\nWednesday 2023-02-22: How can we quantify our assumptions?\n\nWhat:\n\nLash TL, Fox MP, MacLehose RF, Maldonado G, McCandless LC, Greenland S. Good practices for quantitative bias analysis. Int J Epidemiol 2014;43(6):1969–85. [link] [12518 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nLash et al. provide a long overview of good practices for such bias analysis, discussing both the motivation for why one would want to to conduct bias analysis and the mechanics of how to do so (choosing parameters, considering uncertainty). These methods are valuable for most study designs, but may be especially so for “garden variety” observational studies that must rely on basic regression adjustment to have any hope of making causal inferences.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-02-24: Can bias analysis be biased?\n\nWhat:\n\nLash TL, Ahern TP, Collin LJ, Fox MP, MacLehose RF. Bias Analysis Gone Bad. Am J Epidemiol 2021;190(8):1604–12. [link] [6451 words]\nGustafson P. To Bound or Not to Bound: Is That the Question? Epid 2021;32(5):635–7. [link] [2191 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nAlthough sensitivity analysis has been around a long time, quantitative bias analysis continues to be rare, and perhaps one explanation is that it asks a lot from researchers. Other options may include using simple bounds to answer questions about how bad things would have to be to ‘nullify’ an effect, but replacing ignoring assumptions with absurd assumptions leaves much to be desired. Lash et al. demonstrate how to do bias analysis ‘better’ and what can go wrong when it is not done with care. Gustafson, in a comment on some other papers, provides an interesting hypothetical set of scenarios for different ways of combining different study designs and strategies for accounting for bias. I hope you can come away with an appreciation and understanding of why such analyses are valuable."

This week, we are moving on to thinking about the question of to whom our study results should apply. These are core questions that come up in the context of evaluating strengths and weaknesses of studies in peer review (or perhaps grant review), and whether the results of studies may provide actionable evidence.\n\nWednesday 2023-03-08: How should we think about generalizing to other populations?\n\nWhat:\n\nLesko CR, Buchanan AL, Westreich D, Edwards JK, Hudgens MG, Cole SR.

[link] [5308 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nDespite the clear importance of considering to whom study results should apply, there has been little formal work on what assumptions are needed to derive quantitative estimates of effects in different external populations, whether those refer to the target population or a population that is external to the target. These two papers argue that we should consider these formal approaches, and provide some guidance as to what assumptions (and potentially data) would be needed to do so.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-03-10: Should we generalize to specific individuals?\n\nWhat:\n\nKhoury, MJ et al. The Intersection of Genomics and Big Data with Public Health: Opportunities for Precision Public Health.

[link] [6793 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThe second part of our readings on extending results to other populations reframes the question not about transporting results to a different sample, but about how to (and whether we can) derive reliable predictions about treatment effects at the individual level. This is related to ongoing discussions about the concepts of “precision” epidemiology or precision public health, and whether these ideas are really novel or just ways of re-branding what we have always considered in public health, which is targeting when it comes to interventions. There have emerged different ‘camps’ of those more and less enthusiastic about this idea, and these two papers are meant to provide an overview of some of these issues."

Can or should we trust most published research? Is it reliable? Is it replicable and, if not, is that really a problem? Many of these issues have come up in the context of something that has been called the “replication crisis” in science, much of which started when some high-profile lab and social science projects were found not to replicate using similar designs and methods.\n\nWednesday 2023-03-15: Is science broken?\n\nWhat:\n\nOliver, J.

The chapter by Savitz and Wellenius provides some high-level guidance and advice to epidemiologists about their duties to describe evidence in a dispassionate way, but also to make good faith efforts to distill findings in ways suitably tailored for different audiences. Some additional discussion of how to consider biases across different studies when synthesizing evidence is also included. The piece by Blastland et al. is more direct in providing advice to scientists on how to communicate about evidence, largely arguing that our duties are to be transparent in reporting, especially about uncertainty, rather than attempting to persuade or change opinions.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-03-31: How much does “evidence” even matter?\n\nWhat:\n\nGreenhalgh T.

We review a selection of papers that range across methods, principles, arguments, and debates in epidemiology and the wider scientific community.\nRecent versions of this course:\n\nWinter 2023\nFall 2020\n\n\n\nPPHS 617\nThis course covers methods for estimating the effects of social interventions on health outcomes. We introduce and provide the intuition for conducting impact evaluation studies in public and population health and discuss recent methodological developments. We define causal policy effects within the potential outcomes framework and contrast methods for describing associations between an intervention and health outcome with methods for estimating causal effects. We introduce and formally define policy-relevant research questions based on specific causal contrasts. The course format is a mixture of didactic lectures, classroom evaluations of published evaluations, homework assignments, and student presentations. We introduce students to approaches for estimating the effects of social interventions, classified broadly as experimental or observational (quasi-experimental). The section on experimental research covers the use of randomized trials and cluster randomized trials for impact evaluation. The section on observational designs will describe quasi-experimental techniques, including interrupted time series, difference-in-differences, instrumental variables, synthetic control, and regression discontinuity designs."

We are all here to learn from one another, and this course simply won’t work without engagement and participation from all of us (including me). Of course, everyone has their own level of comfort speaking up, as well as varying levels of interest in some of these topics, so I have no expectation that everyone participates equally. What I do ask is that you make a sincere effort to engage with the material, both in terms of the reading and in the discussion forum. Learning how to respectfully express your opinion about conceptual and methodological issues is a core part of being a scientist."

Toward that end, over the course of the semester you will be asked to submit two critical essays that explore a topic of relevance to epidemiologic science.These may be direct responses to material that we read or discuss in class, or they may be essays exploring other topics relevant to your work that demonstrate good-faith efforts to engage with the class material. These should take the form of a commentary similar (in spirit) to those we have read during the semester, and should be no longer than 1500 words. The first one is due on October 22, 2020 and the second one is due on December 7, 2020. I will provide examples of what I think are good pieces of writing to aspire to.\n\n\nClass Participation\nIn addition to the writing assignment, each student will be asked to lead one day of discussion among the topics that we will cover. For that session, you will come prepared to briefly summarize the material we have read, and to prepare some discussion points to help keep the conversation moving. I have created a Google spreadsheet with the current days for each topic here. Please sign-up for a session and we can have a discussion about the readings and where to draw on other resources for the topic."

More information on how Perusall works and how it is integrated into the course is available here (thank you Arizona State!). To access Perusall through MyCourses, navigate to Content > Perusall (readings) > Perusall, and then click the “Open Link” button. This will take you to the Perusall site and automatically register you as a member of the course. If you are having any trouble accessing the readings through Perusall contact me right away. I will not be using Perusall’s grading features, but I expect you to read, post questions, respond to other students questions and answers, and to take an active role in generating productive discussion."

It will help facilitate discussion if you could aim to contribute at least 2-3 points for discussion in Perusall, and bring those to class. During the discussion period in class participation means asking questions about anything in the readings that seems unclear or objectionable, offering respectful arguments and responses, and respectfully listening to the arguments and responses of others. Contributions should be relevant and helpful and demonstrate that you are engaging with the material being discussed at the time, and that you are well-prepared for class."

    "text": "Research Activities\nMy research focuses on investigating how social and environmental factors impact health outcomes and health inequalities. My work is interdisciplinary, combining epidemiological methods with social science approaches to gain insights into the complex interactions between health and society. My research covers a wide variety of topics, but my major areas of focus are:\n\n\nMethods for measuring health inequalities. Measuring and monitoring health inequalities are crucial activites for providing evidence on the impact of medical interventions and policies on vulnerable populations, and for testing the plausibility of etiologic factors that may influence social differences in health. My work takes a systematic approach to health inequality measurement and emphasizes the importance that extra-scientific value judgments play in interpreting evidence on the magnitude and trends of health inequalities.\n\n\nAnalysis of life expectancy trends. Life expectancy is a fundamental and well-established measure of overall population health. I have made extensive use of demographic techniques for decomposing changes in life expectancy between social groups as a tool for generating evidence on the causes of health inequalities.\n\n\nExperimental and quasi-experimental approaches to health inequalities. I use randomized interventions and plausibly random changes in social and economic policies to estimate the causal effects of exposures on population health and health inequalities. I have used econometric techniques such as difference-in-differences and instrumental variables to estimate the health effects of medical marijuana laws, mandatory seat belt laws, and the Great Recession in the USA, user-fees in sub-Saharan Africa, and tobacco policies in Canada."
