  abstract: "Background\nThree genera of human papillomavirus (HPV) infect the oral cavity and oropharynx— alpha (α), beta (β) and gamma (γ). While α-HPV infection is an established risk factor for head and neck cancers (HNC), the role of other genera remains unclear. We aimed to estimate the effect of α-, β-, γ-HPV on HNC using a hospital-based case-control study.\nMethods\nWe recruited incident HNC cases (396) and controls (439), frequency-matched by age and sex from four main referral hospitals in Montreal, Canada. We collected information on sociodemographic and behavior characteristics using in-person interviews, and tested rinse, brush and tumor specimens for HPV genotypes. We estimated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the effect of HPV on HNC using logistic regression, adjusting for confounding. We conducted probabilistic bias analysis to account for potential exposure misclassification, selection bias, and residual confounding.\nResults\nα-HPV genus had a strong effect on HNC, particularly HPV16 (aOR=22.6; 95% CI: 10.8, 47.2). β-HPV was more common among controls (aOR=0.80; 95% 0.57, 1.11). After adjustment for HPV16, we found weaker evidence for γ-HPV (aOR= 1.29; 95% CI: 0.80, 2.08). Combined bias analyses for HPV16 increased the strength of the point estimate, but added imprecision (aOR=54.2, 95%\_CI: 10.7, 385.9).\nConclusions\nα-HPV, especially HPV16, appears to increase the risk for HNC, while there is little evidence for an effect of β- or γ-HPV. β-HPV may have a preventive effect, while γ-HPV may increase the risk of HNC, although to a lesser extent than that of α-HPV. Results for cutaneous HPV were imprecise and less conclusive. Due to possible epidemiologic biases, the true relation between HPV and HNC could be underestimated in the literature. Further improvement in current methods and more studies of the biologic mechanisms of the three genera in HNC development are warranted."

    Background Beyond the prevention of illness and death, vaccination may
    provide additional benefits such as improved educational outcomes. However,
    there is currently little evidence on this question. Our objective was to
    estimate the effect of childhood vaccination on learning achievements among
    primary school children in India.

    Methods We used cohort data from the India Human Development Survey.
    Vaccination status and confounders were measured among children who were at
    least 12 months old at baseline in 2004–2005. In 2011–2012, the same
    children completed basic reading, writing and math tests. We estimated the
    effect of full vaccination during childhood on learning achievements using
    inverse probability of treatment-weighted logistic regression models and
    results reported on the risk difference scale. The propensity score included
    33 potential community-, household-, mother- and child-level confounders as
    well as state fixed effects.

    Results Among the 4877 children included in our analysis, 54% were fully
    vaccinated at baseline, and 54% could read by the age of 8–11 years. The
    estimated effect of full vaccination on learning achievements ranged from 4
    to 6 percentage points, representing relative increases ranging from 6% to
    12%. Bias analysis suggested that our observed effects could be explained by
    unmeasured confounding, but only in the case of strong associations with the
    treatment and outcome.

    Conclusion These results support the hypothesis that vaccination has lasting
    effects on children’s learning achievements. Further work is needed to
    confirm findings and elucidate the potential mechanisms linking vaccines to
    educational outcomes.

    Background Few studies have evaluated the relationship between preterm birth
    (PTB) and maternal education over time. We sought to determine whether
    educational inequalities in PTB have increased in Québec, Canada.

    Methods The authors analysed 2 124 909 singleton live births from 1981 to
    2006, and computed the Relative Index of Inequality (RII) and Slope Index of
    Inequality (SII) with 95% CIs for the relationship between maternal
    education and extreme, very or moderate PTB (≤27, 28–31, and 32–36 completed
    weeks of gestation, respectively) for five periods (1981–1985, 1986–1990,
    1991–1995, 1996–2000, 2001–2006), adjusting for maternal age, marital
    status, birthplace, language spoken at home, parity and infant sex.

    Results Average rates of extreme and moderate PTB increased over time but
    decreased for very PTB. A statistically significant increase in the RII over
    time was present for extreme and moderate PTB. The adjusted RII for extreme
    PTB increased from 1.58 (95% CI 1.24 to 2.01) in 1981–1985 to 3.11 (95% CI
    2.54 to 3.81) in 2001–2006. For moderate PTB, the corresponding RIIs were
    1.53 (95% CI 1.44 to 1.61) and 1.91 (95% CI 1.81 to 2.01). Absolute
    differences in the PTB proportion between the least and most educated
    mothers increased from 1981 to 2006 for extreme (adjusted SII 0.11% vs
    0.28%) and moderate PTB (adjusted SII 1.67% vs 3.11%). Absolute differences
    in the proportion very PTB did not increase.

    Conclusions Relative and absolute educational inequalities in extreme and
    moderate PTB have increased over time in Québec. Relative increases were
    largest for extreme PTB, and absolute increases were largest for moderate
    PTB.

    Background: In cardiovascular research, pre-hospital mortality represents an
    important potential source of selection bias. Inverse probability of
    censoring weights are a method to account for this source of bias. The
    objective of this article is to examine and correct for the inﬂuence of
    selection bias due to pre-hospital mortality on the relationship between
    cardiovascular risk factors and all-cause mortality after an acute cardiac
    event.

    Objective: Investigate the acute impact of COVID-19 mitigation measures
    implemented in March 2020 on a comprehensive range of perinatal outcomes.


    Study design: National registry-based quasi-experimental study.


    Methods: We obtained data from the Dutch Perinatal Registry (2010-2020)
    which was linked to multiple population registries containing
    sociodemographic variables. A difference-in-discontinuity approach was used
    to examine the impact of COVID-19 mitigation measures on various perinatal
    outcomes. We investigated preterm birth incidence across onset types,
    alongside other perinatal outcomes including low birth weight,
    small-for-gestational-age, NICU admission, low-APGAR-score, perinatal
    mortality, neonatal death, and stillbirths.


    Results: The analysis of the national-level dataset revealed a consistent
    pattern of reduced preterm births after the enactment of COVID-19 mitigation
    measures on March 9, 2020 (OR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.68-0.96). A drop in
    spontaneous preterm births post-implementation was observed (OR = 0.80, 95%
    CI 0.62-0.98), whereas no change was observed for iatrogenic births.
    Regarding stillbirths (OR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.46-1.95) our analysis did not
    find compelling evidence of substantial changes. For the remaining outcomes,
    no discernible shifts were observed.


    Conclusions: Our findings confirm the reduction in preterm births following
    COVID-19 mitigation measures in the Netherlands. No discernible changes were
    observed for other outcomes, including stillbirths. Our results challenge
    previous concerns of a potential increase in stillbirths contributing to the
    drop in preterm births, suggesting alternative mechanisms.

    BACKGROUND: For policy questions where substantial empirical background
    information exists, conventional frequentist policy analysis is hard to
    justify. Bayesian analysis quantitatively incorporates prior knowledge, but
    is not often used in applied policy analysis. METHODS: We combined 2000-2016
    data from the Fatal Analysis Reporting System with priors based on past
    empirical studies and policy documents to study the impact of mandatory seat
    belt laws on traffic fatalities. We used a Bayesian data augmentation
    approach to combine information from prior studies with
    difference-in-differences analyses of recent law changes to provide updated
    evidence on the impact that upgrading to primary enforcement of seat belt
    laws has on fatalities. RESULTS: After incorporating the evidence from past
    studies, we find limited evidence to support the hypothesis that recent
    policy upgrades affect fatality rates. We estimate that upgrading to primary
    enforcement reduced fatality rates by 0.37 deaths per billion vehicle miles
    traveled (95% posterior interval -0.90, 0.16), or a rate ratio of 0.96 (95%
    posterior interval 0.91, 1.02), and increased the proportion of decedents
    reported as wearing seat belts by 7 percentage points (95% posterior
    interval 5, 8), or a risk ratio of 1.18 (95% posterior interval 1.13, 1.24).
    CONCLUSIONS: Bayesian methods can provide credible estimates of future
    policy impacts, especially for policy questions that occur in dynamic
    environments, such as traffic safety.

    In recent years, life expectancy in the United States has stagnated,
    followed by three consecutive years of decline. The decline is small in
    absolute terms but is unprecedented and has generated considerable research
    interest and theorizing about potential causes. Recent trends show that the
    decline has affected nearly all race/ethnic and gender groups, and the
    proximate causes of the decline are increases in opioid overdose deaths,
    suicide, homicide, and Alzheimer's disease. A slowdown in the long-term
    decline in mortality from cardiovascular diseases has also prevented life
    expectancy from improving further. Although a popular explanation for the
    decline is the cumulative decline in living standards across generations,
    recent trends suggest that distinct mechanisms for specific causes of death
    are more plausible explanations. Interventions to stem the increase in
    overdose deaths, reduce access to mechanisms that contribute to violent
    deaths, and decrease cardiovascular risk over the life course are urgently
    needed to improve mortality in the United States.

    Background The Tabora Maternal and Newborn Health Initiative project was a
    multicomponent intervention to improve maternal and newborn health in the
    Tabora region of Tanzania. Components included training healthcare providers
    and community health workers, infrastructure upgrades, and improvements to
    health management. This study aimed to examine the impact of trainings on
    four key outcomes: skilled birth attendance, antenatal care, respectful
    maternity care and patient–provider communication.

    Methods Trainings were delivered sequentially at four time points between
    2018 and 2019 in eight districts (two districts at a time). Cross-sectional
    surveys were administered to a random sample of households in all districts
    at baseline and after each training wave. Due to practical necessities, the
    original stepped wedge cluster randomised design of the evaluation was
    altered mid-programme. Therefore, a difference-in-differences for multiple
    groups in multiple periods was adopted to compare outcomes in treated
    districts to not yet treated districts. Risk differences were estimated for
    the overall average treatment effect on the treated and group/time dynamic
    effects.

    Results Respondents reported 3895 deliveries over the course of the study.
    The intervention was associated with a 12.9 percentage point increase in
    skilled birth attendance (95% CI 0.4 to 25.4), which began to increase 4
    months after the end of training in each district. There was little evidence
    of impact on antenatal care visits, respectful treatment during delivery and
    patient–provider communication.

    Conclusion Interventions to train local healthcare workers in basic and
    comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care increased skilled birth
    attendance but had limited impact on other pregnancy-related outcomes.

    Effects of a coal to clean heating policy on acute myocardial infarction in

  type: article-journal

  abstract: >-
    This article reviews 98 aggregate and multilevel studies examining the
    associations between income inequality and health. Overall, there seems to
    be little support for the idea that income inequality is a major,
    generalizable determinant of population health differences within or between
    rich countries. Income inequality may, however, directly influence some
    health outcomes, such as homicide in some contexts. The strongest evidence
    for direct health effects is among states in the United States, but even
    that is somewhat mixed. Despite little support for a direct effect of income
    inequality on health per se, reducing income inequality by raising the
    incomes of the most disadvantaged will improve their health, help reduce
    health inequalities, and generally improve population health.

  abstract: "Treatment effects can be measured on the relative scale (eg, risk ratios, odds ratios) or the absolute scale (eg, risk differences). If the baseline risk of an outcome is different between subgroups, the effect of the treatment will differ between subgroups on at least one scale (relative, absolute, or both). We illustrate this using two examples from the literature where only relative effects were estimated, but conclusions about subgroup differences would likely have changed had absolute effects also been considered. To identify all meaningful subgroup differences, researchers and clinicians should compare\_effects on the relative and absolute scale."
