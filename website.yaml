    In recent years, life expectancy in the United States has stagnated,
    followed by three consecutive years of decline. The decline is small in
    absolute terms but is unprecedented and has generated considerable research
    interest and theorizing about potential causes. Recent trends show that the
    decline has affected nearly all race/ethnic and gender groups, and the
    proximate causes of the decline are increases in opioid overdose deaths,
    suicide, homicide, and Alzheimer's disease. A slowdown in the long-term
    decline in mortality from cardiovascular diseases has also prevented life
    expectancy from improving further. Although a popular explanation for the
    decline is the cumulative decline in living standards across generations,
    recent trends suggest that distinct mechanisms for specific causes of death
    are more plausible explanations. Interventions to stem the increase in
    overdose deaths, reduce access to mechanisms that contribute to violent
    deaths, and decrease cardiovascular risk over the life course are urgently
    needed to improve mortality in the United States.

  abstract: "Treatment effects can be measured on the relative scale (eg, risk ratios, odds ratios) or the absolute scale (eg, risk differences). If the baseline risk of an outcome is different between subgroups, the effect of the treatment will differ between subgroups on at least one scale (relative, absolute, or both). We illustrate this using two examples from the literature where only relative effects were estimated, but conclusions about subgroup differences would likely have changed had absolute effects also been considered. To identify all meaningful subgroup differences, researchers and clinicians should compare\_effects on the relative and absolute scale."
