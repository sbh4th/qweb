I am an associate professor in the Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics & Occupational Health at McGill University. I am also a member of the McGill University [Centre on Population Dynamics](https://www.mcgill.ca/popcentre/) and McGill's [Public Policy and Population Health Observatory](https://3po.ca).

My research focuses on understanding population health and its social distribution, with specific interests in impact evaluation, measuring health inequalities, global health, demography, causal inference, and ethical issues in public health.

More information on specific projects, papers, students, and teaching are in my CV.
