Design        Linked population‐based cohort analysed using a regression discontinuity design, which better controls for confounding than standard observational studies.                     Setting        British Columbia, Canada.                     Population        Singleton pregnancies with a maternal admission for delivery between 31\\,+\\,0 and 36\\,+\\,6\\,weeks' gestation from 2000 to 2016, with follow‐up to 2020.                     Methods        We estimated if risks of childhood respiratory outcomes differed between pregnancies admitted just before the Canadian recommended clinical cut‐off for antenatal corticosteroid administration of 34\\,+\\,0\\,weeks gestation (i.e., with higher probability of exposure to antenatal corticosteroids; ‘exposed’) than those admitted just after this cut‐off (i.e., with lower probability of exposure; ‘unexposed’) using log binomial regression (infant lower respiratory infection hospitalisation) and pooled log binomial regression (asthma).                     Main Outcome Measures        Infant lower respiratory tract infection hospitalisation, inpatient or outpatient asthma diagnosis at 1–18\\,years.                     Results        In our cohort of 21\\,965 children, 412 (1.9\\%) infants were hospitalised with a lower respiratory tract infection and 2287 (10.4\\%) were diagnosed with asthma. Routine administration of antenatal corticosteroids was not associated with infant lower respiratory tract infection (risk ratio\\, = \\,0.95 [95\\% CI: 0.61, 1.37], risk difference\\, = \\,−0.15 excess cases per 100 [95\\% CI: −1.30, 0.99]) or childhood asthma (rate ratio\\, = \\,1.08 [95\\% CI: 0.88, 1.24]~5.49 excess cases per 100\\,by age 13 years [95\\% CI: −1.78, 14.39]).                     Conclusions        We found no evidence that routine administration of antenatal corticosteroids affects the risk of later childhood respiratory illnesses.\n\n\n",
